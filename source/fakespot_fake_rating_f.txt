They are great ear buds they are loud and the music is always crisp and clear. They fit in my ear just great and the ear hooks are what I need because air pods fall out on me. As for the microphone function it is great and I can hear the people I’m talking to and they can hear me and doesn’t sound like a tin can and eliminates much of the background noise. It has a long battery life with double led displays showing all battery strengths. I would recommend getting another pair for my family. Since my purchase I get in the car in the morning and the phone pairs to the car's audio system. When I get to work, I park the car, reach into my bag and take out either the left or the right bud, and put it in my ear. It turns on and connects immediately, with audible notifications, and the music automatically switches from the car to the bud without any button pushes. Then I just turn off the car and go. It is easy to pause the music with a single tap to the outside of the bud. The buds have other touch controls, but I never use them because the Apple Watch serves as a remote for the phone's music app. I am able to make phone calls with either bud, so each one has a mic. The iPhone automatically defaults to use the buds for calls, so I can easily receive calls by answering and hanging up using my watch or the phone itself, although there are controls that will allow one to answer and hang up using taps on the buds.. I can also use talk to text on the watch or the phone. The music automatically resumes when the mic is no longer being used. I can also summon Siri using "Hey Siri.".The case is nice but a bit bulky but nice to have wireless charging.
Battery: The battery will not make it through eight hours of continuous play, but the case charges the bud quickly and you can get a few more hours after only a 15-minute charge. I charge the case once a week, which takes 2 hours. The case also has an indicator that tells you the approximate battery life remaining on the case. It tells you the percentage of charge from what I have experienced. When the battery gets low, a voice comes on to remind you, and it is very persistent, even when you pause the music. So you really have to put the bud back in the case.
Fit: I was amazed at how well these fit. I am 5'6" and I have a small head, so I thought my ears would be too small. The buds come with size adjustment inserts, but I tried them and they didn't improve the fit. The inserts that came pre-installed worked fine. They stay in place with the ear hooks.I don't feel any discomfort after wearing them for a 10-hour shift.
Sound: I don't know much about sound quality relative to the big name brands. I know what music should sound like, and I feel that these supply a rich, balanced sound and good volume level with very little grain or background noise. I know that if I wear both buds and turn the volume up, I will be in my own little world.
Overall these buds are a great value for the price and I am looking forward to enjoying my music library at work for as long as I can.

This is a review for the Boloxa wireless headphones A17.
My package arrived on time. I was impressed with how well the earbuds were packaged in its carrying case.
As soon as I received the A17 I carefully opened the box. I found the user manual, the charging wire, different size ear tips and the headphones in the beautiful carrying case.
The User manual is well written and easy to understand. Illustrations are great too.

Upon arrival, Earbuds appears to be charged and ready for use, but I charged the earbuds to be sure. I do like the fact that the earbuds now uses a USB – C charger. Most of the devices I own also uses USB - C charger so this makes it more convenient for me.
It was easy to pair the earbuds to my phone. No problems. And once it was paired to my phone I tried to play some tunes. It worked nicely. The sound was absolutely outstanding. Treble was great and the Bass was very good. The volume controls are simple to use. I used it for an hour for the first day and there is plenty of battery power left. I used it the following day and again still lots of batter life left again. So I can say the battery life is excellent definitely a plus cause I never remember to charge my devices..
The ear loops are great feature. They keep the earbuds in place and from falling out. This feature is very important to me. I love to exercise and other ear buds I owned without this feature were constantly falling out. In fact they were so light I almost forgot I was wearing them.
I appreciate that there are different ear tip size choices this will ensure the proper fit.
A very nice product. A feature I was not aware of at the time I purchased this A17 was the fact that it comes with a mic so I can receive calls. That is definitely a plus in my book. I thought it was just earbuds to play music while exercising or watch videos during some down time. But I am truly satisfied with this product. From the quality of sound and the ear hook feature and the simplicity of the volume up and down, all in all a great deal. The price is also a great feature too. Definitely a great value. Overall, I would highly recommend the Boloxa headphones A17.

I've tried plenty of in-ear or wrap-around headphones, but these have by far been the simplest I've used. I literally took them out of the box, put them into my ears, and opened my smart phone's bluetooth menu. They made an audible "pairing" sound and were there waiting to connect within 5 seconds. With other (more expensive) pairs of headphones, I have spent minutes to hours trying to get the headphones to pair correctly, play audio out of both sides, or power on. I experienced none of those problems with these headphones. None of these features are particularly new or groundbreaking, but it is enjoyable to order an affordable pair of earphones that execute each part of the equation well.

The earphones come in a stylish, ergonomic case that leaves no confusion about how the headphones have to be placed inside in order to charge. The case fits comfortably into a purse, backpack, or even back pants pocket and also displays a few LED indicators on the inside that relay information about the charge level of each individual phone and the case battery itself. I appreciate not having to guess how much time I'll have before my headphones die, or polling their battery from within the layers-deep smartphone menu.

I also found the audio experience within multiple apps to be much easier than competitor models. I tested out and made sure that these headphones played audio by default with mobile Chrome and Firefox browser apps. They also played seamlessly with the browser version of youtube as well as the standalone Youtube app for android.

The on-ear commands are simple and not too fussy. I don't accidentally skip a track or video by errantly touching my ear, and they also have intuitive volume controls on each earphone that can be activated by a finger touch or hold. The case clasps firmly shut and has a light amount of "stick" or magnetism that keep it from being jostled open in my backpack or falling open when I take it quickly out.

The headphones themselves are a stylish black color, not too eye-catching, but subtle enough that they can be worn without drawing a lot of attention. The rubberized bulb on the end of the earpiece is an effective noise-canceller that drowned out a lot of the nearby sound without even having any audio playing. The effect is not total noise isolation, but it certainly helps music or audio to be heard more clearly. The more robust design also allows for greater in-ear volume for longer periods of time compared to smaller, stick earphones.

5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable, great sounding headphones that actually stay in my ears

After buying various in-ear headphones for walking/running, I've finally found a pair of headphones that doesn’t fall out of my ears! The over the ear clips are the key to keeping the headphones in place, and yet they are still comfortable to wear. I don’t even feel the clips, and the headphones are easy to put in and take out. I’m pretty sure my left ear hole is smaller than my right, and with other headphones even using the smaller earpiece in my left ear would still cause that earbud to fall out. But not with these headphones and the over the ear clip.

The sound quality of these headphones is excellent too, especially the bass, which can be difficult to get in this type of headphones. Usually I look to the over the ear headphones for good bass, but for exercising that’s a bit too bulky and leads to unwanted ear sweat. These headphones do a terrific job of reproducing all the highs and lows you'd want to hear.

I experienced no problems pairing the Bluetooth headphones with my Android phone and my Ubuntu Linux computer. The range is as good as any other Bluetooth devices I use – all of course depending on the Bluetooth adapter in your device and any physical obstructions in between.

While I haven’t had the headphones long enough to see how the batteries hold up long term, I can say that they hold a charge for a very long time. The digital display on the case that shows the remaining battery percentage is a nice touch, too, as are the multicolored lights on the earbuds themselves that show the connectivity status. A reasonable length USB charging cable is included, as are the different size earpieces. The button on the side works well for pausing or skipping tracks. I can’t say I’ve wanted to test just how waterproof these are, but they are advertised to be IPX7 waterproof, so I guess we’ll see if I encounter any wet weather in the near future and I’ll report back if I do. The charging case makes these ear buds super portable. I’m unlikely to even need the charging cable to plug them in when going on trips.

In conclusion, this is a quality pair of headphones all around, and for the price it’s an obvious choice. Pick one up – you’ll be glad you did!

These ear buds are tied with only one other choice going forward! But both are the same store's products. Let's start with some highlights here. First they arrived quickly! Getting started using them took less than 30 seconds! Just remove them from their case, remove the clear film, turn them on with the button on the side, pressing until you see a light flash, find them listed as A17 on your device Bluetooth, and press connect! Easy! Plus they will auto reconnect to the last paired device each time they are removed from the case. Love the sound quality because it's crisp and clean while not being so loud it hurts the ears. Don't get discouraged if you like them loud though because they do pack a punch and when wearing both ear buds, if you want block all other sounds they will do just that! They stay put and you never feel like you need to readjust once they are in. I was lucky and the soft tips that came on the ear buds for me perfectly but if they don't work for you there are other sizes included! And then there is the battery... it's like the energizer, they just keep playing and playing. So while these mighty little things played for a full 8 hrs, I still didn't get the message that the battery was low! When I did charge them afterwards it was only about 1.5 hours for them to be full and the case itself holds 4-5 charges. Since you CAN opt to listen with one ear bud at a time while the other one charges, and if my calculations are correct, you could potentially listen for 16 hrs a day or more and STILL only have to recharge your case one additional time per week! Phone calls were crisp and clean with no difficulty in either party hearing the other. Comes with easy directions for how to press the left or right button to serve your needs. I have to also state that These have the large button on the face that pause/play/answer/hangup/ fast forward... does it all. Volume down on left button- long press, volume top on right button- long press... that's the only difference been the two. Takes a bit of getting used to but all in all a gentle press button that responds quickly without hurting your ear.
Awesome to use and now I'm sad... my husband wants them so I have to get more!

Set up was a breeze. The package comes with clear instructions, and many will be able to do this without reading the booklet. I read everything to make sure that I did everything correctly. Out of the box one bud was 98 percent charged and the other was less. In about one hour of charging with a adapter (not included) both reached 100 percent. . The indicator is wonderful to let you know the percentage and you can even tell when the case is done charging and the earbuds are still charging. Once the red blinking stops you know that the case and buds are both 100 percent. 3 sets or sizes of 'bud ends' are available. The one out of the box is fine with me but nice to be able to replace down the road or have options of size. Paring was amazingly easy. I have an Android Samsung Galaxy phone. With buds out of case, I went to Bluetooth and scanned and selected A17 and it was ready. Easy!!! Next, it was time for what I call the real test. The sound quality is rich and full, and the buds are great at noise cancellation. Very impressed. Make sure they are placed properly in the ear in order to experience the rich and full sound. Easy to control on/off or volume control or skipping tracks are all available with a simple touch on the right or left. Can also answer a call and hangup a call using a few simple touches to the earbud. All clearly explained in document included.
Standard to other earbuds. In summary, I am very happy to find these stylish earbuds on Amazon at a fraction of the price of the big brand name. Hope to get some good use from this product. I purchased the Boloxa Wireless Sports Headphones A17 as a replacement to a big brand earbud which I purchased less than 2 years ago and are far more expensive. The big brand earbud had failed, and the repair or replacement cost are too high. So, I turned to Amazon for a solution and found these Boloxa Wireless Sports Headphones at a great price with every possible feature necessary for music and phone calls. Listening to great music while writing this review. I am happy with this A17 product.

One of the standout features of the Boloxa A17 is its wide and balanced frequency response. Whether you're a fan of bass-heavy beats or prefer the crisp clarity of high notes, these headphones deliver exceptional audio performance across the entire sound spectrum. The sound quality is rich, immersive, and highly satisfying, making it an absolute joy to listen to music, podcasts, or any other audio content.

Connection is easy and reliable. Unlike a few others, these don’t randomly disconnect or go to “Pause”. It also offers a very decent range – I can easily walk from one floor to another floor down the hallway to the other side and very rarely do I lose connection.

Pairing the earbuds with your Bluetooth-enabled devices is a breeze, and the connection remains stable within a reasonable range, ensuring uninterrupted music playback and hands-free calling.

There are two ways to turn off the headset: either by docking each earbud or by holding the buttons on each headset. One thing I figured out is that they won’t power off via the button press while music is playing, so one will need to turn that off first in order to power down the unit. The headset will automatically turn on when removed from the docking station. I don’t see this as a downside because if I am taking them out, I plan on using them.

The only improvement I wish for is a slight tweak in design so that both earbuds can allow volume up and down instead of the left earbud for volume down and the right for volume up. Also, it would be good battery/charging display is on the outside of the case. Other than that, I’m extremely satisfied and do plan on gifting this true gem to friends and family.

I’ve been very impressed with this product so far.

The earbuds rest comfortably on my ears. Normally, I find that the plastic that encompasses my ears causes some soreness. So far, I have not encountered this issue. I like that these are relatively comfortable and unlike the large headphones that encapsulate your ears, these won’t make my ears all sweaty.

The volume setting is as expected and is on par with other headphones that I have used in the past. The clarity of my music is nice and I don’t notice any kind of feedback, fuzziness, or scratchiness. I think it could be a bit louder, but probably not good for my hearing long term.

The headset comes with a small charging station / dock in which you can place your earbuds when you are finished using them. Since we are dealing with electronics, I make sure the little metal pins used to charge each earbud are dry and free of debris. The case itself is a hard case, making it resistant to drop, bumps, or other mishaps.

Pairing the headset is relatively quick and the instructions were very clear.

While charging you can see how much battery life is left on the headset when you dock the earbuds. I find this pretty useful so that I don’t overcharge my electronics. Each charge seems to last between 6 to 12 hours at full volume. This may change if one is on the phone the entire time.

While using the headset to speak or communicate, the person I am speaking with is able to hear me clearly. I don’t have to worry about positioning a microphone, which is nice.

Overall, I really like this product and it provides an excellent value for what is provided.

I received the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones quickly after ordering. They arrived in good shape and with a 95 percent charge. The box included the buds, charging case, charging cable, additional covers, and directions for use and maintenance. The buds paired very easily to both my phone and laptop and have extremely intuitive controls. Since they initial pairing, they always connect easily upon being powered on. They charge quickly and hold their charge for use throughout the day. The case is chunky enough that it is durable and not easily misplaced, but can also easily fit in your pocket. The buds slide very easily in the case for a quick and convenient charge. I wear them to run in Houston, where the temperature exceeds 100 degrees regularly and they have done well despite being regularly drenched in sweat (I do recommend drying and cleaning before charging)! The buds have really nice flexible ear wraparounds, so they stay in very well and are suitable for vigorous exercise. I wear them for almost 8 hours straight each day and find them to be very comfortable throughout. Other buds often leave my ears feeling sore after wearing, but that has not been the case with the Boloxa A17. The volume on these buds reaches an appropriately loud level, where I have found other similar products to not be loud enough to hear when exercising vigorously or vacuuming. The sound quality is clear and crisp, which is unusual at this price point. There are large buttons on both ears that allow you to control volume, change songs forward and backward, pause, answer calls, and use your phone's assistant. The buttons are defined enough that they are easy to find while running and also have enough resistance so that you are not constantly hitting them by accident when adjusting or removing them. A bonus to this product is that, in addition to being able to use both headphones, you can also use each one independently. I appreciate this, as I often only wear one when running in areas that have vehicle traffic or are crowded. I highly recommend these buds - without question the best that I have found anywhere near this price point!

I recently purchased the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations in every way! As someone who enjoys an active lifestyle, I needed a pair of earphones that could keep up with me during sports activities, particularly running. These earphones have been a game-changer for my workout routine.

One of the standout features of the BOLOXA A17 is the charging case. The quality of the case is excellent, and it provides a secure and convenient way to store and charge the earphones. I love the added feature of being able to see the battery percentage on the case. It allows me to plan my workouts better and ensures that I never run out of juice during extended sessions.

They fit snugly and securely around my ears, guaranteeing that the earphones won't fall off no matter how intense my activities get. This level of stability is crucial, and it gives me the confidence to focus solely on my workouts without any distractions.

Connecting the earphones to my phone is a breeze. The Bluetooth pairing is lightning-fast, which means I spend less time fiddling with settings and more time enjoying my favorite tunes.

This pair of cordless earbuds from Boloxa is one of the best I have. This pair is very comfortable around my ears. The hook is well made. The hook is soft enough for the earbuds to be worn comfortably for hours. The hook does a great job of keeping your earbuds in your ear during vigorous movement like jogging or basketball. My wife has very small ears and these earbuds were very comfortable for her to wear. She is the one that turned me on to these earbuds. These earbuds came with three sizes of soft ear cones, but only one hook.

I like that the Boloxa case tells you, with an easy to read digital display, exactly how much charge you have left. It charges quickly and works with all my wireless charging pads. It is really easy to pair with my Android phone. I used my earbuds everyday for 8 hours a day and I didn't need to charge my case for 4 days.

The box comes with the charging case, two earbuds, 3 size cone tips (one on the earbuds already), a USB to c charging cord, and a booklet of instructions. The instructions contain QR codes with videos to assist with adjusting the Android volume limits on your Android phone.

I like the sound quality and it is easy to adjust the volume with the earbuds only. The controls are simple, no need to learn morse code to advance a song or pause/play, and easy to use. They even work with only one earbud at a time.

As there is a microphone in both earbuds you can talk on the phone with only one in use. I would like to see some improvement with the microphone. My wife says this pair of earbuds sounds like I'm talking in a public bathroom, all echoes. The microphone picks up any and all surrounding noises and there is not a way to set the ambiance. It would be nice if they had an app like Sony earbuds do.

I really appreciate my wife turning me on to these. She really likes her pair of wired Boloxa U8I.

I just got my hands on the Boloxa A17 Bluetooth Earbuds and am pretty excited to have these as my day to day ear buds. If you're all about hassle-free sound, music and comfort, keep reading.

The wireless charging case is a bit bigger than others that I've had but it's actually a great thing because I no longer am I going to go digging through my bag for a small case that's fallen to the bottom. Not only does the case keep your earbuds safe but it also shows how much juice they've got left with a large digital display.

Now, sound quality. I put on my favorite playlists on spotify and was blown away. The sound is clear as day, with some serious bass punch. Whether you're into music, podcasting or simply watching TV shows, these buds deliver the fantastic sound. Battery life is pretty amazing as well. I wore these through a workout session as well as many hours of netflix and hulu episodes throughout the evening and they didn't even break a sweat. Perfect for long commutes or even binge-watching sessions.

Oh, and they're waterproof. Not like "Oops, it got wet" waterproof – we're talking IPXX7 waterproof. Rain or sweat, these earbuds can take it. I actually put these on in the pool and have hung out for several hours without an issue - they sound the same after the fact. Let's not forget about those ear hooks. The wraparound earhooks are a game-changer. They're comfy, and they stay put. Whether you're on a brisk walk, maybe even jogging or just chilling, these earbuds won't casually pop out of your ears, as many have for me.

So all in all, I have to say that the Boloxa A17 Bluetooth Earbuds are a great deal. They are easy to operate, can withstand a lot of wear and probably tear (with the way I use things) and appear super sleek on your head. Put it all together with the wireless charging case, killer sound, long battery life, and snug fit, they're a no-brainer. Upgrade your music listening or video watching game with these buds – you won't regret it.

I am not sure if I am like many people, but I have trouble finding a set of earbuds that I can use without them falling out of my ears. Maybe the holes in my ears are larger than most people but most earbuds fall out even if I cram them in, to the point they are uncomfortable, they end up coming out. I have had more success with over the ear headphones but the only ones I tried were wired. I have been looking for a quality set or wireless over the ear headphones that provide quality sound and won’t break the bank. I have found just that in the Boloxa A17 headset.

The headset has a sleek design and are lightweight. The included instructions are clear and well thought out to show the use of all the features of the Boloxa A17 headset. I love the convenient features of this headset. Here are few noticeable features
• They turn on when you take them out of the case and turn off when you put them back in.
• They also stay in my ears comfortably and reliably no matter what angle my head may be in they stay snug and comfortable
• The case has wireless charging capability that works quite well. No need to reposition precisely in one location on a pad
• The buttons for control are large and easily useable even with large fingers.
• There is a charging indicator light on the outside of the case so you can tell it is charging and uses USB-C so I can use the same cable as my phone to charge them.
• The battery life of this headset it amazing. The case provides charge boost when not in use and a single case charge lasts for days.

I have been enjoying my new earbuds doing all kinds of activities for the past couple of weeks and I am truly impressed. These little guys not only meet but exceed my expectations in every aspect, making them a worthy investment for anyone looking for an inexpensive all-purpose pair of earbuds.
First, the sound quality of these earbuds is simply remarkable. Compared to my previous favorite headphones, these have a little extra goodness for my listening enjoyment. The bass is deep and resonant, while the treble is crisp and clear. Whether I’m listening to my favorite songs/podcasts, watching movies, or even taking phone calls, the audio quality is consistently impressive. The awesome L-to-R stereo sounds brings me back to the first time I heard AC/DC and Styx on my Sony Walkman.
Comfort is an important factor for me, and I'm pleased that these earbuds excel in this department. They come with two tip sizes, ensuring a snug fit. I use them as they came out of the box and have not experienced any discomfort. The lightweight design and sleek shape make them easy to wear while relaxing at home, working out, or running - without worrying I might drop one. They are also sweat and water-resistant.
They effortlessly work well with all my Bluetooth devices and the connection remains stable even from 10+ feet away, like when I run out to check the mail. The touch controls make it easy to adjust the volume, skip tracks or answer calls without reaching for my phone. And I really like the automatic reconnection when I take them out of the case.
Battery life is another area where these earbuds excel. With a single charge, I am able to enjoy hours of use. The charging case shows the % of life, fits well in my small purse and provides additional power when I can’t plug in.
With exceptional sound quality, comfort, connectivity, battery life, and low price, these definitely surpassed my expectations. They have certainly been a huge part of my daily routine, and I recommend them to anyone seeking a new pair or to give as a gift.

I recently purchased the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth headphones and, let me tell you, they are a total game-changer! From the first moment, the unboxing experience to the amazing sound quality, everything about these headphones exceeded my expectations.

The Hi-Fi stereo sound is absolutely mind-blowing, transforming every song into a live concert experience. Whether it's blasting some rock and roll during a morning jog or immersing myself in a symphony during a quiet evening, the BOLOXA A17 delivers a top-tier audio experience every time.

One of my favorite features is the wireless charging and digital display. It's incredibly convenient and takes away the hassle of dealing with tangled cables. The digital display shows the battery life clearly, so I never have to worry about my headphones dying on me during a workout or a call.

Speaking of battery life, it's been phenomenal. I can go days without needing a recharge, even with heavy use. This feature has made these headphones my constant companion, from early morning exercise sessions to late-night movie marathons.

The comfort is simply unbeatable. I have worn these for hours at a time without any discomfort. The snug fit ensures they stay in place, regardless of how intense my workout gets. They're also perfect for long hours of remote work or travel.

Let's not forget the IPX7 waterproof rating! These headphones have survived rainstorms during my runs and heavy sweating during intense workouts. The fact that they are so durable yet deliver high-quality sound is simply outstanding.

The vibrant red color and over-ear design give the BOLOXA A17 headphones a sleek, stylish look that I absolutely love. They're not just headphones; they're a fashion statement.

For the price, the quality, comfort, and features of the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth headphones are unmatched. If you're in the market for a reliable pair of headphones that will revolutionize your audio experience, look no further.

These headphones were very easy to work with. They came out of the box charged (both the headphones and the case). I turned them on and they immediately showed up on my phone as able to be paired to. They paired quickly to my phone. Sound quality seems good and they do a decent job of blocking off outside noise.
The headphones themselves fit well and were comfortable around the ears. It comes with three different ear pieces so you can find the right fit. I haven't worked out with them yet but it certainly seems like they won't go anywhere once you find the right ear piece.
The button press controls work well once you learn how to use them. It consistently paused my music when I wanted and started it back up on command. Volume control response is good. Calls also seem to come in clear.
Bluetooth range was decent but does get cut down quite a bit when there are obstacles between the headphones and the device (just the nature of bluetooth).
Now for what I think they could improve on:
1) They could have more fun color options. The only one that was available when I placed the order was black.
2) The last pair I had from this company had the capability to be paired to 2 different devices at the same time. They would play the audio from whichever device last started audio. For example, I would be listening to and watching my TV using the headphones. At the same time they were paired to my computer. So whenever I received an instant message or email, I would stop getting the audio from the TV and would get the chime from the computer. I found this to be a really handy feature. With these new headphones I can only be connected to one device at a time. So I have to go until my Bluetooth settings on my phone, disconnect the headphones, open up the settings on my computer, and connect the headphones in order to switch between my phone and my computer. So it is a bit more cumbersome.

Overall I would say these are a great purchase.

I have had numerous BT headphones of all sizes and styles. I consider myself a bit of an audiophile with a rather expensive theater in my living room (Dolby digital 7.1 with 1000+ watt Yamaha receiver and 7 Infinity speakers and Yamaha Powered sub). My vehicles all have upgraded custom audio as well. given that, I've not heard earphones with this level of dynamic range until getting into the $150-$200 range (Beats or Bose type equipment). I listen to a wide range of music (celtic, 80's-90's rock, Christian Rock, Gospel, Country, and a lot of Classical instrumental) and these provide deep bass and pretty clear highs.

I really love the over-the-ear design as they tend to stay fitted on my ear well even when being pretty active (I work in a shop and around a farm). They are comfortable after numerous hours of wearing.

As for user ease, they are very intuitive. I posted a picture of the instruction manual and with a button on each unit, you can increase volume or skip tracks very easily. They charge via USB C interface and a short cable is provided. There is a great digital display in the case to tell you remaining battery life in the base unit and when you drop each earphone into its slot, there is a battery level bar indicator that appears briefly to let you know the status of that headphone.

They have paired with my laptop, PC, and phone within 10 seconds of searching. And I found out today that the line of sight range (outdoors with phone on bench and me blowing leaves) is probably over 100 ft. (with no obstructions of course). Once I did get out of range and lost connection, there is a vocal alert in the phones to tell you that and as I came back closer to my phone, they rapidly re-connected.

Overall, these are reliable, easy to use and I feel unbeatable for the price.

I recently ordered the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones Stereo Sound for Sports. I was unsure about ordering them because they were different from what I usually use. I have never used ear buds with the loop that wraps around your ears and was a tad leery. These are now my favorite! The ear buds and loop are so comfortable. I almost forget I’m wearing them. The loops are not rigid, but very flexible and sit comfortably on my ears. The buds I normally wear are loop less but more rigid and become uncomfortable after wearing them for a few hours. The Boloxa A17 can be worn for hours without irritation. They do not unexpectedly pop out of my ear during use, either. I’m no longer having to look all over for earbuds that decided to fall out of my ear.

Not only are they comfortable, but the sound is also fantastic! The bass is phenomenal. Sometimes I only use one bud while I’m at work. The sound is still great! The button controls on the buds make it easy to operate the different functions of the buds. If someone walks in and I must have a conversation with someone I just tap the button and it pauses. Phone calls are clear and easy to answer as well.

The charge lasts for a long time. I can get about 8 hours of use out of one charge. If I wear only one bud, I can get double the time. I switch them out when one bud needs charging. The case is also very nice. I don’t have to plug the case in to charge every day. Normally, I can get 3 days out of one charge.

I plan to order another pair of the of the Boloxa A17 so I have a pair at work and a pair for home. I’m highly satisfied with this purchase. I have not found a better set of earbuds at this price point.

I have been using these for about a week now. The sound quality is better than the other ear buds I have tried in this price range.
Overall physical construction quality of the ear buds and case/charger are good. Flush buttons on the ear buds blend in seamlessly. The ear buds fit into the case easily, even with the ear hooks and sync up to charge every time. The ear hooks on the buds are flexible and comfortable. They also really help to keep them in place when working out and moving around. This allows you to not need to push them into your ear canals as tightly, but still stay in place. That makes them more comfortable for me, especially when working out.
The bluetooth syncing was quick and the signal is strong. I can go to the other side of my house and leave my phone in the other room and the connection stays strong. Latency is low.
The case charges the ear buds quickly, and I like the indicators for the individual ear buds charging as well as the charge level of the battery in the case - handy! The battery in the case also charges quickly - even via USB plugged into a laptop. Battery life of both the ear buds themselves and the case are also good. I was able to charge the ear buds several times (didn't count) before needing to charge the case again.
Sound quality is good both for podcasts and music with good bass level for ear buds - better than other ear buds I have used.
The buttons on the ear buds are flush and work well for the controls syncing to my phone.
Delivery was quick - had them in 2 days with Prime.
Overall I am very satisfied with these ear buds, especially at this price point! I would buy them again.

These headphones are great. I was never sure that I would like the Earbuds that wrap around my ears. But these are extremely comfortable. I did use the larger tips. (A set of three is included) The fit was surprisingly comfortable. I like the feel much better than my others that are supposed to magically stay put in my ears. These stay comfortably and snuggly attached to the ear. No more having them fall out while exercising. The control is great because there are easy to find physical push buttons which means you cannot accidentally touch the wrong spot and have the music stop or change. Quite easy to answer incoming phone calls with these as well. The sound performance is particularly good. If you get them sealed in your ears correctly there is a full range of bass and clear highs. The seal does create a seal which suppresses noise. I used them in the pool for a workout and they worked fine. They do last a long time on a charge. I have never used them long enough for them to need recharging during a full day. They recharge easily in the case which has a clear display, and it has a built-in battery to charge on the go when necessary. I am not sure how many recharges there are in the case before it needs recharging. The case recharges with an included USB-C cable. There is a Flashing LED that shows until charged. My set is black as pictured. The size is palm sized. It is easy to hold on to them and they will easily fit in your pocket or purse. They were quite easy to pair with my phone. They are in pairing mode when taken out of the case the first time. Their construction is very solid, and they should last a long time. I highly recommend these headphones - especially for the price!!!!

These headphones have great sound quality for the price. Do not expect audiophile level sounds, but for the average user these headphones sound great! They fit snugly in the ear and even include different ear tips in case you need a different size. The sports wing tips that go around your ear make these super convenient for exercising since you know the headphones will not pop out of your ear like some other headphone brands that only barely stick in your ear. I was looking for a solution since my previous pair of Bluetooth headphones would fall off when I’m working around the house and I didn’t want to have to deal with something around the neck that feels heavy or gets in the way.
I also appreciate the buttons on both headphones that allow some more intricate controls (you can go to the previous track using your left ear instead of having to press at least 3 times – which with my previous headphones I feel like never registers correctly.) Additionally, it’s nice since you can pair each headphone separately if needed in mono mode and still control it with a button on either. I like to do this when working around the house or at a coffee shop so I can hear family or friends if they are calling for me.
Lastly, the headphones case is a great upgrade for me. I love the display that shows how much battery you actually have left instead of having to guess or just always plugging it in – it also shows you if the headphones are charging or not which is convenient. Lastly, the best part is that the case can wirelessly charge now! I’m sick of every new electronic needing a new cable and having to keep track of all of them or use up my phone charging cable – nice to be able to just set it on a wireless charger and leave it there!

I ordered and received these headphones with great anticipation. Not to belittle the rest of this review, but I really like these headphones. A lot of it for reasons of personal taste as well.
Not a lot of people will be too particular about the button on the sides of them; but let me tell you, there is a big difference between having to press something very hard into your ear for it to register, and to just lightly touch it. A lot of times with more carelessly designed headphones the earbud will straight up press a sharp point into your inner ear (ouch).
These headphones have been designed to where the pressure spreads out all three your ear, and the result is that it is barely a pressure felt from using the button. Also, I preferred the precision of a button over the and precise happenstance of the touch button was features so popular now (the only reason I can see for designing them that way is that it is easier for them to be made waterproof). These also are waterproof without having to rely on that negative item.
Okay, now for the more basic stuff. The sound is very good. It’s so good to the point that I may attach them to my monitor and use them just for watching stuff online (I’m not so worried about the sound quality on watching YouTube videos and music and such). But if you want to know one thing about these headphones, you cannot ask for better sound for the price.
The battery life is fine. It does not say in the instructions or anything, but is about eight hours at maximum volume. I did not time it or anything like that. So please do your own research.
In a final analysis, these are excellent headphones for the money. I’m not sure about how many recharges in the charger container, but just by the sides of it, it should be a great deal of them.

The Boloxa Wireless Sports headphones arrived just a few days after I placed the order. The box it came in was well packaged, and it had a complete user manuel with all the information, warnings and instructions, and the entire thing was in English. Some product inserts have very little information, and they are in so many different languages, there isn't space to say much in English, so I really appreciated having an entire printed booklet come with the headphones. After reading the instructions and taking them out of the box, I turned them on and they paired immediately with my iPhone. I tested the volume of both speakers, and I could only turn it up about halfway as the sound is so good and clear that any higher would have been too loud.

The appearance is very sleek, and though I have never owned earbuds/headphones that wrapped around the ear, I was delighted by how comfortable they were to use, despite having a number of ear piercings (see photo). I went about my day, enjoying listening to music and videos while I did laundry and washed dishes. Despite being used for several consecutive hours, the battery remained mostly full. When I placed them back in the case, they were charged to full again in less than an hour. Awesome! When I ordered these headphones, I didn't expect to love them as much as I do, which is somewhat unfortunate for me, as I have already promised them to my 21 year old son. Ah well, I guess I can always order another set for myself, and at the current price of $29.99 I feel they are very good value for money. I have already owned a set of earbuds from this company for some time (they look like airpods), so I know they make good, quality products that last. I absolutely recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for good value for their money, and who wants a product that will last. Five stars, all the way!

Let me start off by saying that I am a 72 year old man who is moderately functional with technology. I have always had a problem with earbud type headphones. They either fall out easily or do not usually feel comfortable. As a result I have always used over the ear headphones. During Prime Days I came across some earbud type blue tooth headphones at a great price and decided to give them a try. I really liked them. They fit well and were more comfortable than the over the ear set I have when listening for a long period of time. I still had a concern about them coming out if I were moving about, so I decided to try these wrap around headphones. I absolutely love them! They are very comfortable and give the added security that I wanted. They stay in place no matter what activity I do. I'm not an audiophile, but the sound quality to me is fantastic whether listening to music or podcasts. They are not noise cancelling, but they certainly block out normal distracting sounds while still allowing you to hear anything that you need to be alerted to. The longest I have worn them is 4 hours so I cannot say if they would work for someone who needs to use them for longer stretches. I have used them daily for well over a week and am just now charging them for the first time so they have good longevity on a charge. They connect easily to my iPhone, iPad, and Grace Digital internet radio. Some people may feel the need to spend a lot more money to get the highest sound quality possible, but these are more that adequate for the average user and the price for what you get is phenomenal.

I purchased the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones Stereo Sound for Sports, first let me tell you the design is very comfortable, lightweight and ergonomic, fits well for ears is that all you need during workouts.
If you fit the earphones tightly in your ears, you can enjoy excellent quality bass sound, which allows you to reduce outside noise. Microphone is very good too, when I make a call, the other person hear me strong and clear
Battery life is amazing and the battery charge is very fast too, battery life indicator is very useful, show it the battery charge percentage, this is really excellent because allows me to know how much charge I have. In addition to that, it has two charging systems: Type-C charging and Wireless Charging.
Bluetooth connection is very easy and quickly, BOLOXA A17 has many functions, which makes it more efficient like answer call, end call, reject call, next track, previous track, play or pause, volume up, volume down for song or videos YouTube, another good function is when you put it in your ears, audio system tells you “Power on, connected”
The headphones have a good range, between my devices and the headphones, I have tested it up to 5 meters away. Material quality is very resistant, I have dropped many times and headphones are ok. I can use only the right headphone on and it works without the need to have both in my ears, so my left ear can be free to be aware of my surroundings
I have connected it to many devices such as my iPhone, Apple TV, Android phone and on my Windows 11 Laptop and it has been compatible with all of them, without any problem, pairing was quickly.
My advice, if you are looking for quality, comfort and good price this is the best choice that I have found and used.

I'm a fan of wireless headphones. I recently bought a pair of these new Boloxa wireless headphones. These are my second pair that I buy for sporting purposes. I've been using them for a few weeks and they are very effective. They fit easily in the ear, it's easy to wear and control these. the battery lasts a long time. They are excellent for doing any sport, especially jogging, since they remain fixed and do not fall off.
The delivery time was indicated by the supplier, there were no delays.
I tried them for the first time with my Xiaomi cell phone and they connected right away, then I did it with my daily use laptop and they also paired quickly. Very easy when answering calls, raising or lowering the volume, its use is friendly. The music also sounds very good. These headphones have buttons on the sides that facilitate their use when exercising. They are also firm headphones, that is, they fit the ear and do not fall out easily. Regarding the sound, I am not an expert on this subject, but I understand that it is good, it is not heard with interruptions. The charging case is practical since it has a screen that indicates the percentage of battery charge that the headphones have. The best thing about these headphones is that they are type c cable and fast when charging. In addition, the battery is long lasting. Also the case is fast charging.

Part of the accessories is that it comes with a small usb cable for charging and some pairs of ear pads.

Another benefit in favor is that they are resistant to water, perhaps not for long.

They are perfect for daily use, work and exercising. I recommend them for personal use or as a nice gift.

These headphones are great! I haven't used fully wireless headphones before, so it's a whole new experience for me. The sound is great, I can't hear outside noises very well while listening, which is great. A lot of headphones that are on the cheaper side don't have sound quality like these do. I also tested the range of the headphones to see if I could go into other rooms and still be connected to the device. I've had other devices where I could go a certain distance and be okay, but one step too far and it's disconnected. These headphones haven't had that issue, I can walk all around my house and the sound is crystal clear. I'm excited for these headphones, and to see how they will hold up. So far the battery life is excellent and have not needed to charge them after multiple long uses. I love that they have a case to store them in and that I can charge them in so they don't get dirty and they are handy to grab and throw into my purse. Bonus for these is no chord, so they can not get tangled or get lost within my purse because of the case. It is super helpful. Tonight I used the headphones to watch a show while doing dishes. With headphones in the past I would have to pause my show while I rinsed the dishes because I couldn't hear what was going on. The water completely drowned out the sound of the headphones. But tonight, things were completely different. These headphones keep the noise level outside quiet enough that I didn't have to blare the volume or pause my show to be able to hear it. Super solid headphones and very worth the price! I would highly recommend them.

Well my earbuds showed up today which I’m super stoked about because the earbuds I am currently using while working fit in my ears but they aren’t snug.. so I ordered these in hopes they will fulfill my issue I’m currently having.

I have to say that these earbuds immediately paired with my iPhone 14 😁 after having them paired I quickly put these on my ears and they slid right on and then in went the ear piece and you know the feeling when you have an exact fit 🥳 🤠 I knew off the muscle these are gonna be the ones that do me right… after doing this and having my extreme feeling of satisfaction I went to my pandora app where my music kicked on out went all the outside noise and in went some kick ass music.. I have to say I truly think these are gonna be the best buds I’ve ever owned..
I went through all the prompts that the instructions manual informed me of.. one push to stop the music one push to stop the music then a punch and hold to turn the volume up and down

Considering these are a fraction of the price of the major retailers ear buds I have to say I am super impressed and so excited that I now have a set that will stay put in my ears and that sound amazing!

If you looking at the reviews and run across mine just know I’m telling the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me god! 😂 naw seriously get these ear buds they are freaking awesome and they come with different ear size rubber pieces for the smaller and bigger holes!

I recently purchased the Boloxa A17 wireless headphones, and I must say, they left me thoroughly impressed. These headphones are nothing short of phenomenal, offering a fantastic audio experience coupled with impressive features that are hard to believe at such an affordable price point.

One of the standout features of the Boloxa A17 is its wide and balanced frequency response. Whether you're a fan of bass-heavy beats or prefer the crisp clarity of high notes, these headphones deliver an exceptional audio performance across the entire sound spectrum. The sound quality is rich, immersive, and highly satisfying, making it an absolute joy to listen to music, podcasts, or any other audio content.

Battery life is another area where the Boloxa A17 truly shines.

You no longer have to worry about running out of battery midway through your workout or daily routine. The convenience of such extended battery life is truly commendable.

One common frustration with wireless headphones is the fear of them falling out and getting lost. However, the Boloxa A17 comes with an ingenious design that addresses this concern. These headphones are anchored securely to your ears, ensuring a snug fit and eliminating the risk of them slipping off during exercise or vigorous activities. This feature alone sets them apart from many other wireless headphones on the market.

The inclusion of a charging case with a battery life indicator and charging status further enhances the overall user experience. This handy addition allows you to keep track of the remaining battery life of both the headphones and the case itself, ensuring that you never run out of power unexpectedly. It's a small but thoughtful detail that adds convenience and peace of mind.

One aspect that left me astounded was the affordability of the Boloxa A17. Given the exceptional audio quality, long-lasting battery life, and secure fit, it's hard to fathom how they manage to manufacture such an outstanding product at such a reasonable price point. It's a testament to the brand's commitment to providing value to its customers without compromising on quality.

I purchased the old model of these headphones (the B16 Bluetooth headphones from Boloxa) because I wanted a reasonably priced option for wireless headphones. I've absolutely loved them so the A17 model seemed like a perfect upgrade. The sound profile of my old headphones is rich and full. They turn on when you take them out of the case and turn off when you put them back in. They also stay in my ears reliably.

When I heard about the A17 model, I became interested in having an option that wraps around my ear for even better security during exercise. Even though the B16s stay in fairly well, I have to adjust them and push them in every now and then to make sure they aren't going to fall out. The A17 model felt like a good option for going running and extended use so I went ahead and bought them to try out.

The A17s have just arrived and I'm really happy to find the same quality sound that I love from my B16 headphones. I seriously don't understand why anyone would pay more money for bluetooth headphones when you can get this kind of rich sound out of something so accessibly priced. They A17 headphones have buttons on them that allow for more control (volume, skipping a track, answering a call and more) without having to interact with your phone or whatever the headphones are connected to. It's going to take me a while to memories the controls (press twice for next track, long press for volume change, press both to answer a call etc.) Once it's in my head I think I will have a lot of fun with this feature but it is a little tricky to master at first.

This is my first pair of headphones that hug the ear like these do, and they are quite comfortable. I always worried that they would scratch or squeeze my ear but I can barely feel them when they are on.

The only way to turn off my old headphones is to return them to the case. This means that if I forgot my case somewhere far, I have to just let the batteries run down. I don't have this issue with the new A17 headphones! All I have to do is press the button on both ears for 5 seconds and they will turn off so I don't have to find the case to keep them from running out of battery. Im really excited to have both the A16 and 17 headphones at my disposal now. They both have their advantages and I foresee me being able to use these for a long time.

Been trying out many, many different sports-oriented wireless earbuds over the past two years (occiam, apekx, okeefe, Tozo, etc., you name it). Over numerous disappointments and many frustrating experiences, took a flyer on this relatively new product and I’m very glad I did. Across all the ones I’ve tried in this price range, this one by far is the best. A few highlights below:

1) Sound quality is up there even against mainstream brand products that that boast noise-canceling features such as Beats and Skull Candy (by the way, way overrated). Music is crisp, podcasts are clear and it responds quite well when I was toying around with equalizer apps on my phone. No issues with phone calls even in crowded public spaces.

2) Connection is easy and reliable. Unlike my experience with Tozo and a few others, these don’t randomly disconnects or goes to “Pause”. It also offers a very decent range – I can easily walk from my desk down the hallway to the other side and very rarely do I lose connection.

3) Battery life is quite amazing. Instead of having to charge every other night before going to bed, these can easily last me almost and entire week just using the case to charge during showers and meetings. I pretty much wear them all the time – during my commute, at work, in gyms, out running errands, etc.

4) The earpieces are very comfortable to wear all day, and unlike a few others do not fall off. I also very much appreciate the big, round buttons controls on the side. They are easy to reach / find, do not require much effort to press, and most importantly not based on touch sensors where I can accidentally drop a call or stop a track when I’m just making slight adjustments or taking one side off.

5) This is one of the very few models that come with wireless charging, and it works quite well. No need to frequently adjust the positioning to make it work.

The only improvement I wish for is a slight tweak in design so the battery / charging display is on the outside of the case. Other than that, I’m extremely satisfied and do plan on gifting this true gem to friends and family this Christmas season.

One last note…for these type of everyday use earbuds, anything IPX 5 / IPX 6 or above is more than adequate (and this is IPX 7). Paying more for IPX 8 is total overkill and not worth the extra costs.

5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Bluetooth Headphones for Running

I recently purchased these Bluetooth headphones, and I must say they have exceeded all my expectations! As an avid runner, finding the perfect pair of headphones that stay in place, sync effortlessly, and remain comfortable throughout my workouts has been a challenge. However, these headphones have completely changed the game for me.

The first thing that impressed me was the snug and secure fit. They come with multiple ear tips, allowing me to choose the perfect size that fits my ears perfectly. No matter how intense my runs get, these headphones stay firmly in place, eliminating any worries of them falling out or needing constant readjustments.

Syncing these headphones with my phone was a breeze. The Bluetooth connectivity is exceptionally stable, and the pairing process is almost instantaneous. No more frustrating connection dropouts during my workouts; it's just smooth, uninterrupted music to keep me motivated and focused.

Comfort is a crucial factor for me during extended runs, and I couldn't be happier with the lightweight design and soft ear tips of these headphones. Even during long-distance runs, I forget I'm wearing them, as they don't cause any discomfort or irritation.

The sound quality is fantastic, delivering clear, crisp audio with deep bass that energizes my runs. The noise isolation is impressive too, effectively blocking out distractions from my surroundings.

Overall, I highly recommend these Bluetooth headphones to any fellow runners or fitness enthusiasts. They offer an impeccable fit, seamless syncing, and unbeatable comfort, making them the ultimate companion for your workout sessions. Get ready to elevate your running experience with these remarkable headphones!

5.0 out of 5 stars An ideal blend of function, form, and performance in a budget-friendly package
Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2023

The A17-series earbuds have clearly blended the best of prior models into a clean and well-functioning successor. Right out of the box, the quality shows with the case, which supports both wireless and USB-C charging, permits easy removal of the earbuds, and has a very nice heft & snap. The earbuds themselves are extremely comfortable, fit securely even during vigorous exercise, and paired straight-away. The new Bluetooth 5.3 chipset shows demonstrable advantages over the previous 4.0 standard with noticeably faster reconnection and reception - where an older BT4-based earbud would drop out due to distance or obstruction, the A17s keep going. I've been very happy with the sound quality - from audiobooks to classical to hard-hitting workout tracks, the audio came through clearly and with a full spectrum; you may want to swap the silicone earbud shields with one of the other sizes to tailor the fit, which allows for even better noise isolation and bass response. The headphone controls have a satisfying mechanical click, and are cleanly responsive. The true-wireless buds also synchronize nearly insantly when worn together, but function just as well when wearing a single earpiece at a time. The battery life is also fantastic - I get an entire day from the earbuds alone, and the case will charge them many times over!

Bottom line, if you're looking for robust sound & performance in a well-designed and comfortable package, and need something that is secure during physical activity, the A17 earbuds are a very easy choice that is just as easy on your wallet.

If you're a fitness enthusiast like me, searching for the perfect earbuds for your workout sessions, look no further! These wireless earbuds have been a game-changer for me, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

Firstly, the waterproof feature is a game-changer for gym-goers who tend to sweat profusely during workouts. I used to worry about sweat ruining my earbuds, but these earbuds are built to withstand the toughest workouts and intense perspiration. Sweat all you want, and they'll stay perfectly functional, no matter how intense your exercise routine is!

The Hi-Fi sound quality is simply outstanding. Every beat and note come through crystal clear, enhancing my workout experience to a whole new level. The immersive audio motivates and energizes me, making those intense training sessions feel effortless.

One feature I genuinely adore is the button control. As someone who works out in gloves, I've struggled with touch controls on other earbuds. But with these, I can easily manage my music, calls, and even access voice assistants without any hassle. It's perfect for quick adjustments during my workouts, allowing me to stay focused and in the zone.

Overall, these wireless earbuds have exceeded my expectations in every aspect. They are an excellent choice for gym enthusiasts who demand durability, exceptional sound, and user-friendly controls. If you're looking for earbuds that won't disappoint during your fitness journey, I highly recommend giving these a try.

I was in the market for a pair of inexpensive headphones to use when I didn't want to risk my more expensive earbuds, and I stumbled upon these Bluetooth headphones. They've turned out to be exactly what I was looking for.

They fit comfortably on my ears, which is essential for me, especially during workouts or casual walks. The sound quality has impressed me. I'm no audiophile, but they sound really good, providing clear and balanced audio.

The price was just right for what I was willing to spend on a secondary pair of headphones, and I feel like I've received great value for the money. An unexpected but appreciated feature is the case's ability to display the battery level and charging status of the headphones. It's something I didn't know I needed, but now I find it quite useful.

The design of both the headphones and the case is pleasing to the eye. They're not overly stylish, but they're nicely made and suit my tastes.

What really makes these headphones stand out for me is that they don't just meet my needs; they exceed them. They're not just a backup pair; they've become a regular part of my routine. They perform exceptionally well without costing a fortune.

Overall, I'd recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a dependable, reasonably priced option to use alongside their more expensive earbuds. They're not merely satisfactory; they've proven to be a great addition to my daily life. I'm quite pleased with this purchase.

These are, by far, the most fantastic ear buds I have ever owned and worth every single penny! They are so comfortable I can sleep with them in (back sleeping), they stay exactly where I want them throughout an entire workout, the sound quality is phenomenal, the noise cancel mode is stellar, and the transparency mode is exactly what you'd want for it. Not to mention the color - I adore the color! I cannot recommend these earbuds loud enough! You don't even know what you're missing without them! I rarely write reviews of products, and for anyone like me, who is always a little suspicious of over the top reviews - this is NOT a paid review, I was not asked for a review, I bought these with my own money, and I came back on the website myself to sing these praises. You won't be disappointed. Whether you're in a noisy gym or a crowded cafe, tune out and focus on your tunes with ease. These Earbuds use some seriously smart tech to detect and cancel external noise. So go ahead, transport yourself to a world of pure audio bliss, with not a peep from the outside world to distract you. Designed to fit seamlessly into your active lifestyle - and your ears. With the ergonomic gel fin design, these earbuds offer unbeatable comfort. The gel tips ensure you can listen for hours without fatigue. No matter the intensity these will beat it.

I bought this item (Boloxa A17) for working out, walking/biking/weight lifting. I wanted a push button control vs touch sensitive control. I have earbuds with sensitive touch control and it’s a pain to get it to work the way you want it to, this product (Boloxa A17) works and sounds great and you can easily adjust the volume up and down with ease. When needed you can also fast-forward or go back to songs with ease. The buttons on each ear piece makes it easy to control what you need it to do without the worry of trying to fumble around and push the wrong buttons. Very easy to adjust volume and change tracks on your music selection and answering and making calls. You also have two ways of charging, usb-c and wireless charging, which works great for my setup. I’ve worn these for up to 4 hours at a time with no issue as far as it hurting my ear canal or losing power. I like the way it hooks around the ear, it’s secure and I have no issues with it falling out. As for waterproof IPX67, I would say they definitely have been soaked from the use I’ve put them through including rinsing them off under the water spigot for cleaning and show no signs of failure. I would buy this product again!

I ride an average of 400 miles a month. I need sports headphones that are TOUGH, that have enough battery for a 100 KM ride, that stay in my ears over the most challenging terrain, that provide high quality sound so that whatever I play, I can hear it clearly. The BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones excel in every one of these requirements. Yesterday I finished a 60 mile gravel ride. These headphones performed like magic. For the first hour and a half I listened to the Eric Metaxas biography of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Didn't miss a word. For the rest of the ride I listened to my Grateful Dead channel. The base midrange and treble were ALL delivered with great fidelity. The batteries were still operating after nearly 3 hours and the earbuds stayed in and delivered without blocking the surrounding sounds which is a great safety factor. It was nearly 100 degrees by the end and I was dripping with sweat but the WATERPROOF earphones continued to operate, unbothered by the sweat. These earphones did everything I could possibly ask of them, delivered terrific quality sound and remained comfortable for the entire ride. If you are looking for world class sound that is reliable and long lasting, I have never experienced anything better. Get yourself a pair of BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones. They may be the last sport earphones you ever buy!!

I may have odd shaped ears because up until I received the A17 model, I've never been able to wear earbuds and have them stay in place in my ear. Especially when I exercise, which is primarily when I wear the earbuds. In addition to not moving in my ear, the next thing I noticed was the sound quality. Very impressive! I'm not an expert but we all know when something sounds either good or off just a bit. These sound good at both ends of the scale. I used to travel every week for years and at the time I purchased a pair of very expensive noise cancelling over the ears head phones. They worked wonderfully for years, until one day they just quit working. I can't say the A17's work as well as the over the ear model I wore on an airplane (because I have no plans to be on an airplane) but they seem to work as well in the gym where there is always background noise.
Overall I'm very impressed with the quality, both sound and fit, and would highly recommend the A17 Headphones. Especially for the price! They are comparable to my old over the ear model that cost over ten times as much!

These earphones are very comfortable and fit extremely well. I was able to complete a workout and I did not have to worry about the earphones falling out. After a long workout, these earphones are easy to clean, and I did not have to worry about them being damaged by too much sweat. I also like the feature that it's waterproof and it was raining I did not have to worry.

The sound is incredible. The noise cancelation is awesome. There was minimal background outside noise interference with my music or podcast. I like the sound quality and the bass of these earphones. The microphone is great and I can hear calls very clearly. Having earphones where you don't have to continue to put them on a charger multiple times throughout the day is a plus. I can go hours upon hours without having to recharge these earphones when listening to music, YouTube, or a podcast. Another cool feature is the transmission range. I can leave my phone upstairs and still hear my music clearly downstairs, this is awesome.

Wireless headphones is a must for me along with the wireless charging. It's multifunctional and also user friendly. It takes seconds to pair to your device. This is by far some of the best earphones I have purchased.

I have a pair of Bose QC35s and love them, but definitely not gym headphones and wanted something small but would not fall out of my ear when I am on equipment. I tried the type you insert into the ear but those never really fit well and would always fall out. So started my search for a different type of bluetooth headphones to use at the gym and around town. Had a list of requirements: 1. Needed to be compact and the fit on my ear, 2. The sound quality and battery life. Stumbled on these and was very curious as this hit a majority of the requirements from what I can tell so decided to give them a try.
Was very impressed on the quality and battery life when I received them. Definitely not Bose but I really do not mind using these at the gym, around town or even when doing yard work. They have a loop that make them stay put on my ear and come with different size ear pieces to make sure they fit snug in your ear. They never fell off while running on the treadmill which was a big concern with the Apple style ones for me.
Besides the initial charge for 100% when I received them I have not had to charge them up. Been using them at the gym for about a week for 6-8 hours and outside while doing yard work (I did initially charge them to 100% before using). They are light and at times forget I am wearing them.
I was telling my wife about them the other day and she tried them on and liked them a lot as well. Noticed the headphones go missing only to find them in my wife’s gym bag!!! She doesn’t want to give them up. Haha. Will definitely order another pair. For the value cannot go wrong.

These headphones are at a really good price point for the great quality. The sound quality is very nice with good lows and vocals. They have a very comfortable fit, especially I usually don’t like the type that go in your ear like these do but they don’t cause discomfort. So far the battery life is very impressive, been listening to them all day and doesn’t even seem like the battery has gone down at all. The case is relatively compact and can obviously charge them even more so realistically don’t even know when I will have to charge them. I tested them out with a phone call and they worked great. I like more sleek ones for day to day but like they advertise they are great for workout with the wrap around the ear. Can run or move around at the gym and not always having to adjust them or have them fall out. They don’t rub the back of your ears so I started not to notice them while working on stuff. For the price point they really are great headphones, obviously better exist out there if you are wanting to pay a ton of money but for me these are great.

The A17 headphones are a good value at this price point. In the photos you can see everything that comes in the package as well as what they look like after you remove the little plastic piece that blocks charging when you receive them. The exterior look and feel is similar to the G17s but the sound quality is noticably better. They also share the only downside of the product, being that there is no active noise canceling so I wouldn't recommend them for calls if you have a noisy background. However, at this price point, the sound quality is quite good and I recommend them if you're just wanting to use them for listening to music or audiobooks while doing chores around the house or working out at the gym. The headphones have a nice feel going over the ear and I didn't have any issues with them while I was running on the treadmill. I was also listening to an audiobook for several hours while I was mowing the lawn and the headphones lasted the entire time. Overall, the quality of the A17s are on par with some headphones I've had in the $50-$100 range but are sold for much less. I would recommend them for anyone who is looking for a decent set of headphones for a lower price point.

One thing I really appreciate is the ear hook design – it gives a secure fit, so I don't have to worry about them slipping off while I'm on the move.

What an excellent pair of headphones! I’ve had many many pairs of headphones over the years, what can I say, I’m not interested in paying $200 plus for AirPods just to have them fall out of my ears while I’m skiing or biking. Anyways, I’m so impressed with these headphones! They come at a budget price point which was very important to me. If I lose them it’s not really a big deal. Been using them for about a week and they’re checking all the boxes. Connected easily to all of my devices. They wrap around the ear so they’re on and secured even during vigorous movement and exercise. Sound quality is very good as is the noise cancellation. This is a small thing probably more “me” than other users but I LOVE that these headphones have a physical button for pause/skip/siri. I think the physical button is infinitely superior to the touch tech button. I never have to wonder if I touched it enough times or the right way.

Long story short, these are excellent and economical wireless headphones. If you have gotten this far in reading my review, just buy them already, you won’t regret it!

Pairs easily; open charging box and remove the earpieces and they immediately go in pairing mode or connect. I've tried other headphones with charging cases and they would pair or connect to your bluetooth device as soon as you open the charging case. I prefer the way these work where you actually have to remove them from the case first.

Sound is good, not the best, but pretty good. I'd prefer a bit more base, but just a personal preference.

Controls are easy and intuitive. One button on the left and right earpieces.

I ran with them earlier and they worked well. One issue I've had with other wireless bluetooth earbuds is that they would get out of sync and one side would stop working. While running with these, they did seem to go out of sync for a split second, but then they would reconnect immediately. Hardly even noticeable. Problem may be with my phone though.

Overall I'm pleased with these so far.

I just got my A17 headphones and couldn't wait to go on my morning run to try them out. Wow! Wow! Wow! The fit is incredible, and I don't feel like I have earbuds on at all. They're incredibly light weight and have a beautiful full rich sound with bass tones coming through.

Now I can see with the charging case exactly when I need to recharge but it really isn't necessary because when you store them, they automatically begin recharging. The wireless charging case is sturdy and solid, and I can just lay the charging case on my wireless charging puck. It's so easy and no fumbling to plug in wires.

Having been impressed with the results of their previous wired version, I was eager to try out their wireless offering. And I'm glad I did.

I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for high-quality yet affordable earbuds. The design and practicality of the earbuds are perfect for everyday wear. Over the last week, I’ve used them all throughout school, in public, and while riding my bike. While the earbuds were secure, the over-the-ear piece was comfortable and didn’t make my ear sore over time, as I have experienced with similar earbuds. The audio quality is impressive, especially for the price, and I haven’t had any problems with audio leaking out of the earbuds when on higher volume. The case holds a charge along with the earbuds, so I haven’t had to charge them frequently or at inconvenient times. Because of the case’s power display, I haven’t had them lose power in public where I was unable to charge them as I have with other earbuds and headphones. Overall, I have been extremely pleased with both the company and the quality of their products.

Sometimes all you need are the fundamentals, and that’s where these earbuds manage to rise above the crowded field of sub-$50 competition. Their sound puts some emphasis on the bass but still manages to come through nicely balanced overall with very good clarity for this price range.

The earbuds last for up to seven hours of continuous playback, and the compact case holds three additional charges. Their large physical buttons are easy to use, and the earbuds fit snugly with the loops for all sizes of ears (tried on 3 different people with different tips).

This is my 3rd pair (different models) of Boloxa headphones and I am continued to be amazed at the quality of products they offer for a fraction of the price of name brands. Tested them under different conditions (running, walking and workouts) and they stay in place because of the loops which are quite comfortable.

Great headphones for the price.

First I have killed 5 pairs of earbuds. I am a sweaty gym rat. It is easy for moisture to get trapped in some. So far I am pleased with these.
The fit is secure and comfortable. Actually probably the most secure I have used at this time.
The sound is good and clear. No rattle or anything. Good balance of sound. I don't hear anything else either.
The button is awesome! I have grown to hate the touch sensor buds. These have one button. Sweat does not interfere with function!! So frustrating to listen to music and lifting, running, ect and suddenly only hearing 5 seconds of a song because sweat activates touch sensors... these ear buds solve that!!! The manual is very clear. My attention span is low right now and the manual has everything done clear with pictures and words.
Phone calls also work!!! Alot of headphones and ear buds suck. My friends tests them with me and said this is the best so far!!!

So far I love them!

These earbuds are truly impressive and I have used quite a few. The design in black is sleek and modern, making them quite the stylish accessory. What's particularly good is their ability to stay securely in place during sports activities or while commuting on a bus or bike – a practical feature for us on-the-go folks.

The sound quality is quite exceptional, thanks in part to the ear tips that effectively block out ambient noise, elevating the overall music experience. The design choice to offer extra support behind the ears results in a slightly larger case, which is easily forgiven once you realize it supports wireless charging. Charging convenience is always a plus, right?

In conclusion, I can confidently recommend these earbuds. If you're a fellow enthusiast of running or active lifestyles, these earbuds could be your perfect companions. They strike a fine balance between style, functionality, and great sound.

These earbuds are great for working out. I weight lift and had trouble with AirPods falling out several times. The over the rad attachment was too expensive to make sense for me to buy after spending so much on the AirPods themselves. These earbuds are great quality for the money and exactly what I needed for the gym.
AirPods are basically the same but for ten times the price. These are much more affordable and practical for my budget. I do not need the most expensive, most popular earbuds when I am going to use them at the gym and get them sweaty and gross. This brand is reliable and makes good value products for the money. I will definitely buy their earbuds in the future. Buying products like this on Amazon is much more affordable than buying products from electronic stores or the mall. Will definitely buy from seller again.

The ear hook buds are great for running or other activities and don't fall out. They sit really nice in the ear and have surprisingly good bass. Particularly for the price. The charging case is solid and good size anf holds the earpieces well without rattling. The microphone for phone calls is fair, but sufficient, causing my voice to sound a little quiet. If I am in a room instead of outside it's better. The battery life has lasted me through workouts and conference calls, so no complaints, and the case has a surprisingly long battery life - several charges of the buds. The percent remaining flashes on the case which is convenient. I have not used the wireless charging but if I had one I would love charging this without the plug. Overall these are very good and I'm super happy with them.

I waited a long time to evaluate these headphones. They quickly became my "go to" when I walk and at work. The earbud part is not the most comfortable (probably bc I have not put the correct size padding on) but my favorite part is the ear hoop. They never fall off when exercising, cutting the grass, never, because of the ear hoop. I will even hang them from my ear and leave the bud part outside my ear when listening to podcasts or music. The batteries seem to last a long time. The longest I needed to use them was 4 hours and they lasted the entire time.

When I use them for calls, as I frequently do, nobody complains about the sound, volume, or clarity and that is important!

I would buy these again!

This is my third pair of headphones from this company. The first two pairs were extremely impressive. My AirPods stopped working and I just could not justify dropping another $100+ on a set of them. I scoured reviews and after reading the reviews for this product, coupled with their amazing warranty, it was a no brainer. One of my first pairs got commandeered by my son because he liked them better than his AirPods too! The battery power is beyond impressive. I have to charge the case maybe once every two weeks. I listen to music while I work and they block out outside noise while supplying quality sound. They’re comfortable and stay in my ears well. The controls are easy to use and phone call quality is also crystal clear. These are the only headphones I will purchase from now on.

First it is nice to see when the case is fully charged since it has a little light bar to check on charging. Sync is so easy with laptop, chrome book, Ipod, Ipad and my cell phone. Ear Buds hold a charge extremely well. When you place the ear bud in case for charging it shows you how much you have left and then starts charging. When you place an earbud back into the case it shows you by bars how much was used, then blinks red as the ear bud is charging. They are very comfortable fitting over the ear. The charger is the latest usb C cable so you can use the same cable if you have the latest fire. The case is nice and small that you can throw into a small purse for last minute errand so you can use to listen to music on a run or any thing.

First let me say if your're looking to replace a $200 set of headphones and expect the same sound quality, then these probably aren't for you.

However, if your looking for a good quality set of headphones for a great price then these will meet your needs.

The headphones come nicely packaged and include the earbuds, charging case, charging cable and 3 sizes of eartips.

The headphones are well built. The earbuds fit nicely and are very comfortable. The over the ear design ensures that earbuds won't pop out during workouts.

The setup was very simple. Remove the earbuds from the case. Open the bluetooth settings on your phone, find the A17 headphones in the list, then click on them and pair. I was connected in a few seconds.

The sound quality on these are on par with other low end earbuds. They are great for Phone calls, Audio books and podcasts. When listening to music I found the the bass to be lacking for my preferences. . The sound was a bit tinny. However for listening to podcasts or audio books they were great.

These are a nice set of headphones for the price.

Today I want to share my excitement about my recent purchase: a new pair of headphones! Unpacking them was quite an experience. Opening the box, I found a stylish case that protected the headphones from any damage. Pulling them out, I noticed their modern and sophisticated design, with a glossy black finish and metallic details that added a touch of style.

Construction-wise, the headphones felt solid and well-made. The cord was sturdy and seemed durable. Also, I was impressed that they came with different sizes of ear tips to fit my ears comfortably.

When plugged into my device, the sound quality was amazing. The bass was deep and powerful, while the treble was clear and defined. I was able to hear every detail of my favorite songs like never before.

One standout feature was its noise-canceling capabilities, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the music without the distractions of my surroundings.

In short, my unboxing experience with these headphones was exciting. Their elegant design, solid construction, and exceptional sound quality make them a perfect addition to enjoying my music on the go. I am delighted with my new pair of hearing aids!

These headphones are comfortable, great sound, and compact. I've been using them for 2 weeks and I wish I'd bought them sooner.

I rotate headphones frequently, from the WH-900n that I travel with to the more compact sets <$50 that I use everyday. For my daily sets I look for good microphones for calls and passive sound insulation for when I'm in the shop, mowing the lawn or biking. These fit snugly in and around my ears without falling out meeting all my needs, with a solid sound quality. The charging via wireless induction or USB-C works great, and over the last 2 weeks I've really only had to recharge the case once fully.

These are my new go to headphones!

They are comfortable, even though they’re sporty; the around the ear the design is unlike any other I’ve tried. I have yet to run the battery all the way to 0% which they also have a digital meter inside the charging case which is cool too. I’ve left my phone in the car and gone into my local grocery store. And my audiobook kept playing until I went down an aisle. The range was at least 100-120 feet. Through a wall. Pretty amazing. So far the only negative is the charging case is big. But I can work with it. It’s harder to lose it at least. And it’s unlike other people’s. So it won’t get stolen. Haha 😆

I hate 'virtual' buttons that aren't visible and don't respond consistently. The A17 has a real button on each piece that gives a good, tactile klik. They're comfortable enough to wear to bed-I use a sleep app that feeds different sounds to each side, so lightweight earpieces I can roll over on without pain, or them breaking or falling out is crucial, and these work well for that. The in-box display is something lacking in models I've gotten from other companies-I know how charged up each earpiece is, and how much is left in the charge pod. I do a lot of audiobooks while walking, shopping, and background noise is minimized well. Very happy with these!

The Bluetooth headphones exceeded my expectations during vigorous workouts and cycling sessions. They securely stayed in place and provided exceptional sound quality, effectively blocking out external noise in the gym. For cycling, wearing just one earbud allowed me to stay aware of my surroundings. While the volume control limitation to the left unit was a minor inconvenience, my phone's accessibility on my handlebars made it manageable. Remarkably, the headphones survived an accidental trip through the washing machine, showcasing their durability. The absence of a cord was a welcome feature, avoiding tangles and discomfort. These headphones offer a valuable package for their price, combining great sound quality and convenience for active individuals seeking a seamless audio experience.

I use Android phones (4 of them actually, S22 Ultra, Pixel 4a 5G, Motorola Styus 5G and Revvl 6 Pro 5G) but I use Apple Airpods 3 as my go to earbuds..., why?, because they are the only open earbuds design with good sound, good microphones, lightweight comfortable design that sit best in my ear lobes without having to push anything into my ear canals and feel all that pressure in my head. If you are an Android user that wants an open ear design but don't want to shell out $140 to get good sound, good speakers and mic, lightweight (but not as lightweight as the Airpods 3 I confess) comfortable earbuds, you cannot go wrong with these earbuds.

There are many different options out there, one of which is the GNMN pair that looks similar to this, but boy are they different. Not only is the BOLOXIA better at the bass, soundstage, and comfort, it is better designed for user use in my opinion.

At work I use gloves regularly, which makes headphones controls more than a little annoying with all of the earbuds that have the fancy tap feature. Which is why I truly appreciate the step back to the trusty button. It doesn't feel crunchy, it's easy but not too easy to press, and is big enough and in a good enough position to easily find and use with gloves.

Another thing I would like to add is how truly comfortable these are compared to the GNMN pair, which were already comfy. The GNMN pair for me hurt when I pushed them into my ear trying to hit the button, but these don't have that.

I own both sets of wireless headphones. The green pair fits fine, but it has drawbacks that this new Boloxa solves. Old: no charge indication, poor sound quality, and the ear buds are on the opposite sides - meaning the bud on right is placed in the left ear - sounds minor but annoying.

The Boloxa has excellent sound - clearly the most important feature, good bass even. Great functionality of the buttons - both buds have functional buttons. USB-C charging = faster and becoming a standard. The bud on the right, goes in the right ear! Paired with my Samsung S10e easily, and handles calls well.

I received my BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones a few days ago and I’ve had the chance to use them in several different situations. Sitting in my office, they are great for work calls - clear sound and easy to control - volume up, volume down, next/previous track, answer, etc. Walking my dog, same story - easy to adjust volumes and mute/unmute. No issues with fit or keeping them in place. This is a particularly good feature when doing anything that involves a little more movement - other buds I have tried tended to move or fall out when I was jogging or working out - these stay in place. No issues with getting them wet from a little sweat either. Charging is super simple in the case and I have found that I get better battery life than I have seen with other buds. So far, I have charged them once and it seems like I will only need to charge about once per week at my normal usage rate. For the price, it would be hard to beat these headphones. I recommend!

3. The deep base and the noise is really rich.
4. Along with standard soft tip ear piece, the two extra pieces included are perfect for smaller ears, like my kids
5. Lastly, the battery has been better than expected. Most of my older headphones would last only a 2 hours, but these are lasting on the higher end of 6 hours continuously.

The A17 Bluetooth Headphones Stereo Sound by Boloxa has really given me a better option in headphones. Low profile while in the ear and the charging cradle is straight forward, connect it to a USB port and forget about it. I have a variety of Bluetooth headphones, from over the ear to in the ear to sports and these A17 do bring these styles into one. I enjoy switching from each style depending on the environment I'm in (office/home) and now that these A17 have a combined style I can stick to using 1 longer, especially with the long battery life. One of the major features I like about these is that each unit comes with a control button which means I can pause the music from either my left ear or the right ear and continue with the other unit. Also switching to next or previous songs while playing music is as simple as touching the correct unit. The price is right at the market value as well, I can't wait to see what they (Boloxa) have coming in the future.

I've been using the Boloxa A17 headphones for the past 3 days -- overall very satisfied. The sound quality is great. Decent amount of bass. They fit comfortably and don't fall off during workouts. They charge quickly. I love that the case has a battery that can provide portable recharge if I don't have the USB-C cable with me. I also use them for phone calls and teleconferencing -- my wife was on the other end of the call and said that the microphone picks up sound perfectly.

Great headphones! i have tried multiple brands. These actually stay in my ears which is difficult for me. . You can use them individually and answer the phone with no problem. the go into the case with no issues. They are balanced to the point that you do not even realize they are in your ears. I would buy them very happy with my purchase. I have a total of 4 different types and manufacturers. These are the best so far Boloxa continues to create great noise cancelling headphones.

These earbuds are great. They work perfectly and with no problems what so ever. The earbuds' battery lasts for a long time, which is perfect for long trips in the car or on a plane (I had multiple flights so these things were lifesavers). They are also great for exercise because the hooks make it so that it doesn't fall out of your ear. I run everyday on gravel/dirt and the previous ear buds I've had fell out of my ears multiple times, causing it to get dirty and make me stop in the middle of my run just to clean them. It came to the point where I just held the earbuds in my ear while i ran. It became really irritating and I decided to try something different, hoping for better eaebuds, and Im glad I did. recommend this to anyone who is active or just want to have clear, working ear buds.

I was skeptical about the quality a pair of $30 headphones can deliver, but these headphones are very good. Sound is very crisp and the Bluetooth lag is almost non-existent. When the earpieces were fully charged, I used them for almost an hour and the battery went down only about 3-5%. I personally like the fact that they have ear hooks (I know, it's subjective), so they don't fly out at the most inconvenient moment and I don't need to get them deep down into my ears.

The one thing that makes or breaks the earbuds I purchase is how well it will fit on my ear, and these probably have the best grip out of any of my previous purchases. It feels rather strange at first, since the noise cancellation does a really good job at making outside noises near silent, but it ends up fitting comfortably around my ear, it causes no issues and it is very much flexible so there is no risk of them falling off and getting damaged. I highly recommend them!

I received this set from the seller. I have had wireless earbuds before. However, they are ones without the ear clip/hook. With my old buds, I am always worried about losing them or falling off when in gym or walking or public transit. So, I was very interested when I saw these. They do fit well and no fear of falling off. In addition, the little case it comes with is type C which is great. But, for me the mindblowing thing is the wireless charging. Just put the case over my phone charger and boom it charges. I have heard Apple buds have this but having such convenience at cheap price was great. It also shows the current battery percentage in the case, not just lights to indicate battery level. I will be honest; sound quality is nothing to rave about, but it is adequately loud and clear. All I need for them to be functional during my commute, exercises etc. which it does well. I wish it connected to two devices simultaneously, but it doesn't. So, you have to disconnect one to connect to another. You can use only one ear if you wish (like cycling). If you are purchasing, be on lookout for good offers and coupons instead of full price.

They are great ear buds they are loud and the music is always crisp and clear. They fit in my ear just great and the ear hooks are what I need because air pods fall out on me. As for the microphone function it is great and I can hear the people I’m talking to and they can hear me and doesn’t sound like a tin can and eliminates much of the background noise. It has a long battery life with double led displays showing all battery strengths. I would recommend getting another pair for my family. Since my purchase I get in the car in the morning and the phone pairs to the car's audio system. When I get to work, I park the car, reach into my bag and take out either the left or the right bud, and put it in my ear. It turns on and connects immediately, with audible notifications, and the music automatically switches from the car to the bud without any button pushes. Then I just turn off the car and go. It is easy to pause the music with a single tap to the outside of the bud. The buds have other touch controls, but I never use them because the Apple Watch serves as a remote for the phone's music app. I am able to make phone calls with either bud, so each one has a mic. The iPhone automatically defaults to use the buds for calls, so I can easily receive calls by answering and hanging up using my watch or the phone itself, although there are controls that will allow one to answer and hang up using taps on the buds.. I can also use talk to text on the watch or the phone. The music automatically resumes when the mic is no longer being used. I can also summon Siri using "Hey Siri.".The case is nice but a bit bulky but nice to have wireless charging.
Battery: The battery will not make it through eight hours of continuous play, but the case charges the bud quickly and you can get a few more hours after only a 15-minute charge. I charge the case once a week, which takes 2 hours. The case also has an indicator that tells you the approximate battery life remaining on the case. It tells you the percentage of charge from what I have experienced. When the battery gets low, a voice comes on to remind you, and it is very persistent, even when you pause the music. So you really have to put the bud back in the case.
Fit: I was amazed at how well these fit. I am 5'6" and I have a small head, so I thought my ears would be too small. The buds come with size adjustment inserts, but I tried them and they didn't improve the fit. The inserts that came pre-installed worked fine. They stay in place with the ear hooks.I don't feel any discomfort after wearing them for a 10-hour shift.
Sound: I don't know much about sound quality relative to the big name brands. I know what music should sound like, and I feel that these supply a rich, balanced sound and good volume level with very little grain or background noise. I know that if I wear both buds and turn the volume up, I will be in my own little world.
Overall these buds are a great value for the price and I am looking forward to enjoying my music library at work for as long as I can.

This is a review for the Boloxa wireless headphones A17.
My package arrived on time. I was impressed with how well the earbuds were packaged in its carrying case.
As soon as I received the A17 I carefully opened the box. I found the user manual, the charging wire, different size ear tips and the headphones in the beautiful carrying case.
The User manual is well written and easy to understand. Illustrations are great too.

Upon arrival, Earbuds appears to be charged and ready for use, but I charged the earbuds to be sure. I do like the fact that the earbuds now uses a USB – C charger. Most of the devices I own also uses USB - C charger so this makes it more convenient for me.
It was easy to pair the earbuds to my phone. No problems. And once it was paired to my phone I tried to play some tunes. It worked nicely. The sound was absolutely outstanding. Treble was great and the Bass was very good. The volume controls are simple to use. I used it for an hour for the first day and there is plenty of battery power left. I used it the following day and again still lots of batter life left again. So I can say the battery life is excellent definitely a plus cause I never remember to charge my devices..
The ear loops are great feature. They keep the earbuds in place and from falling out. This feature is very important to me. I love to exercise and other ear buds I owned without this feature were constantly falling out. In fact they were so light I almost forgot I was wearing them.
I appreciate that there are different ear tip size choices this will ensure the proper fit.
A very nice product. A feature I was not aware of at the time I purchased this A17 was the fact that it comes with a mic so I can receive calls. That is definitely a plus in my book. I thought it was just earbuds to play music while exercising or watch videos during some down time. But I am truly satisfied with this product. From the quality of sound and the ear hook feature and the simplicity of the volume up and down, all in all a great deal. The price is also a great feature too. Definitely a great value. Overall, I would highly recommend the Boloxa headphones A17.

I've tried plenty of in-ear or wrap-around headphones, but these have by far been the simplest I've used. I literally took them out of the box, put them into my ears, and opened my smart phone's bluetooth menu. They made an audible "pairing" sound and were there waiting to connect within 5 seconds. With other (more expensive) pairs of headphones, I have spent minutes to hours trying to get the headphones to pair correctly, play audio out of both sides, or power on. I experienced none of those problems with these headphones. None of these features are particularly new or groundbreaking, but it is enjoyable to order an affordable pair of earphones that execute each part of the equation well.

The earphones come in a stylish, ergonomic case that leaves no confusion about how the headphones have to be placed inside in order to charge. The case fits comfortably into a purse, backpack, or even back pants pocket and also displays a few LED indicators on the inside that relay information about the charge level of each individual phone and the case battery itself. I appreciate not having to guess how much time I'll have before my headphones die, or polling their battery from within the layers-deep smartphone menu.

I also found the audio experience within multiple apps to be much easier than competitor models. I tested out and made sure that these headphones played audio by default with mobile Chrome and Firefox browser apps. They also played seamlessly with the browser version of youtube as well as the standalone Youtube app for android.

The on-ear commands are simple and not too fussy. I don't accidentally skip a track or video by errantly touching my ear, and they also have intuitive volume controls on each earphone that can be activated by a finger touch or hold. The case clasps firmly shut and has a light amount of "stick" or magnetism that keep it from being jostled open in my backpack or falling open when I take it quickly out.

The headphones themselves are a stylish black color, not too eye-catching, but subtle enough that they can be worn without drawing a lot of attention. The rubberized bulb on the end of the earpiece is an effective noise-canceller that drowned out a lot of the nearby sound without even having any audio playing. The effect is not total noise isolation, but it certainly helps music or audio to be heard more clearly. The more robust design also allows for greater in-ear volume for longer periods of time compared to smaller, stick earphones.

These ear buds are tied with only one other choice going forward! But both are the same store's products. Let's start with some highlights here. First they arrived quickly! Getting started using them took less than 30 seconds! Just remove them from their case, remove the clear film, turn them on with the button on the side, pressing until you see a light flash, find them listed as A17 on your device Bluetooth, and press connect! Easy! Plus they will auto reconnect to the last paired device each time they are removed from the case. Love the sound quality because it's crisp and clean while not being so loud it hurts the ears. Don't get discouraged if you like them loud though because they do pack a punch and when wearing both ear buds, if you want block all other sounds they will do just that! They stay put and you never feel like you need to readjust once they are in. I was lucky and the soft tips that came on the ear buds for me perfectly but if they don't work for you there are other sizes included! And then there is the battery... it's like the energizer, they just keep playing and playing. So while these mighty little things played for a full 8 hrs, I still didn't get the message that the battery was low! When I did charge them afterwards it was only about 1.5 hours for them to be full and the case itself holds 4-5 charges. Since you CAN opt to listen with one ear bud at a time while the other one charges, and if my calculations are correct, you could potentially listen for 16 hrs a day or more and STILL only have to recharge your case one additional time per week! Phone calls were crisp and clean with no difficulty in either party hearing the other. Comes with easy directions for how to press the left or right button to serve your needs. I have to also state that These have the large button on the face that pause/play/answer/hangup/ fast forward... does it all. Volume down on left button- long press, volume top on right button- long press... that's the only difference been the two. Takes a bit of getting used to but all in all a gentle press button that responds quickly without hurting your ear.
Awesome to use and now I'm sad... my husband wants them so I have to get more!

Set up was a breeze. The package comes with clear instructions, and many will be able to do this without reading the booklet. I read everything to make sure that I did everything correctly. Out of the box one bud was 98 percent charged and the other was less. In about one hour of charging with a adapter (not included) both reached 100 percent. . The indicator is wonderful to let you know the percentage and you can even tell when the case is done charging and the earbuds are still charging. Once the red blinking stops you know that the case and buds are both 100 percent. 3 sets or sizes of 'bud ends' are available. The one out of the box is fine with me but nice to be able to replace down the road or have options of size. Paring was amazingly easy. I have an Android Samsung Galaxy phone. With buds out of case, I went to Bluetooth and scanned and selected A17 and it was ready. Easy!!! Next, it was time for what I call the real test. The sound quality is rich and full, and the buds are great at noise cancellation. Very impressed. Make sure they are placed properly in the ear in order to experience the rich and full sound. Easy to control on/off or volume control or skipping tracks are all available with a simple touch on the right or left. Can also answer a call and hangup a call using a few simple touches to the earbud. All clearly explained in document included.
Standard to other earbuds. In summary, I am very happy to find these stylish earbuds on Amazon at a fraction of the price of the big brand name. Hope to get some good use from this product. I purchased the Boloxa Wireless Sports Headphones A17 as a replacement to a big brand earbud which I purchased less than 2 years ago and are far more expensive. The big brand earbud had failed, and the repair or replacement cost are too high. So, I turned to Amazon for a solution and found these Boloxa Wireless Sports Headphones at a great price with every possible feature necessary for music and phone calls. Listening to great music while writing this review. I am happy with this A17 product.

They come with different-sized ear tips to ensure a secure and comfortable fit for various ear shapes and sizes. The lightweight construction, combined with the ergonomic design, ensures that the earbuds stay in place during workouts, daily commutes, or extended listening sessions. You can wear them for hours without experiencing any discomfort or fatigue. I recommend getting another pair for my family.

One of the standout features of the Boloxa A17 is its wide and balanced frequency response. Whether you're a fan of bass-heavy beats or prefer the crisp clarity of high notes, these headphones deliver exceptional audio performance across the entire sound spectrum. The sound quality is rich, immersive, and highly satisfying, making it an absolute joy to listen to music, podcasts, or any other audio content.

Connection is easy and reliable. Unlike a few others, these don’t randomly disconnect or go to “Pause”. It also offers a very decent range – I can easily walk from one floor to another floor down the hallway to the other side and very rarely do I lose connection.

the Boloxa A17 earbuds provide approximately 5 hours of playback time on a single charge. The included charging case extends the usage time by providing multiple additional charges on the go. Pairing the earbuds with your Bluetooth-enabled devices is a breeze, and the connection remains stable within a reasonable range, ensuring uninterrupted music playback and hands-free calling.

There are two ways to turn off the headset: either by docking each earbud or by holding the buttons on each headset. One thing I figured out is that they won’t power off via the button press while music is playing, so one will need to turn that off first in order to power down the unit. The headset will automatically turn on when removed from the docking station. I don’t see this as a downside because if I am taking them out, I plan on using them.

The only improvement I wish for is a slight tweak in design so that both earbuds can allow volume up and down instead of the left earbud for volume down and the right for volume up. Also, it would be good battery/charging display is on the outside of the case. Other than that, I’m extremely satisfied and do plan on gifting this true gem to friends and family.

I’ve been very impressed with this product so far.

The earbuds rest comfortably on my ears. Normally, I find that the plastic that encompasses my ears causes some soreness. So far, I have not encountered this issue. I like that these are relatively comfortable and unlike the large headphones that encapsulate your ears, these won’t make my ears all sweaty.

The volume setting is as expected and is on par with other headphones that I have used in the past. The clarity of my music is nice and I don’t notice any kind of feedback, fuzziness, or scratchiness. I think it could be a bit louder, but probably not good for my hearing long term.

The headset comes with a small charging station / dock in which you can place your earbuds when you are finished using them. Since we are dealing with electronics, I make sure the little metal pins used to charge each earbud are dry and free of debris. The case itself is a hard case, making it resistant to drop, bumps, or other mishaps.

Pairing the headset is relatively quick and the instructions were very clear.

While charging you can see how much battery life is left on the headset when you dock the earbuds. I find this pretty useful so that I don’t overcharge my electronics. Each charge seems to last between 6 to 12 hours at full volume. This may change if one is on the phone the entire time.

While using the headset to speak or communicate, the person I am speaking with is able to hear me clearly. I don’t have to worry about positioning a microphone, which is nice.

Overall, I really like this product and it provides an excellent value for what is provided.

I received the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones quickly after ordering. They arrived in good shape and with a 95 percent charge. The box included the buds, charging case, charging cable, additional covers, and directions for use and maintenance. The buds paired very easily to both my phone and laptop and have extremely intuitive controls. Since they initial pairing, they always connect easily upon being powered on. They charge quickly and hold their charge for use throughout the day. The case is chunky enough that it is durable and not easily misplaced, but can also easily fit in your pocket. The buds slide very easily in the case for a quick and convenient charge. I wear them to run in Houston, where the temperature exceeds 100 degrees regularly and they have done well despite being regularly drenched in sweat (I do recommend drying and cleaning before charging)! The buds have really nice flexible ear wraparounds, so they stay in very well and are suitable for vigorous exercise. I wear them for almost 8 hours straight each day and find them to be very comfortable throughout. Other buds often leave my ears feeling sore after wearing, but that has not been the case with the Boloxa A17. The volume on these buds reaches an appropriately loud level, where I have found other similar products to not be loud enough to hear when exercising vigorously or vacuuming. The sound quality is clear and crisp, which is unusual at this price point. There are large buttons on both ears that allow you to control volume, change songs forward and backward, pause, answer calls, and use your phone's assistant. The buttons are defined enough that they are easy to find while running and also have enough resistance so that you are not constantly hitting them by accident when adjusting or removing them. A bonus to this product is that, in addition to being able to use both headphones, you can also use each one independently. I appreciate this, as I often only wear one when running in areas that have vehicle traffic or are crowded. I highly recommend these buds - without question the best that I have found anywhere near this price point!

I recently purchased the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations in every way! As someone who enjoys an active lifestyle, I needed a pair of earphones that could keep up with me during sports activities, particularly running. These earphones have been a game-changer for my workout routine.

One of the standout features of the BOLOXA A17 is the charging case. The quality of the case is excellent, and it provides a secure and convenient way to store and charge the earphones. I love the added feature of being able to see the battery percentage on the case. It allows me to plan my workouts better and ensures that I never run out of juice during extended sessions.

When it comes to the earphones themselves, they are specifically designed for sports enthusiasts like me. The ear hooks are fantastic! They fit snugly and securely around my ears, guaranteeing that the earphones won't fall off no matter how intense my activities get. This level of stability is crucial, and it gives me the confidence to focus solely on my workouts without any distractions.

Connecting the earphones to my phone is a breeze. The Bluetooth pairing is lightning-fast, which means I spend less time fiddling with settings and more time enjoying my favorite tunes. The sound quality is surprisingly good for the price. The audio is clear, and the bass is punchy enough to keep me motivated throughout my entire run.

I also appreciate the durability of these earphones. They have endured a fair share of accidental drops and still work flawlessly. It's evident that BOLOXA has put a lot of thought into the design and construction of these headphones.

In conclusion, the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones are a fantastic choice for sports enthusiasts and fitness fanatics. The charging case with the battery percentage indicator is a thoughtful addition, and the secure ear hooks ensure a worry-free workout experience. The quick and stable Bluetooth connection, along with the impressive sound quality, makes them a steal at this price point.

If you're looking for reliable, high-quality Bluetooth headphones that are perfect for sports, I highly recommend giving the BOLOXA A17 a try. They have truly become my go-to sports companion, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase!

This pair of cordless earbuds from Boloxa is one of the best I have. This pair is very comfortable around my ears. The hook is well made. The hook is soft enough for the earbuds to be worn comfortably for hours. The hook does a great job of keeping your earbuds in your ear during vigorous movement like jogging or basketball. My wife has very small ears and these earbuds were very comfortable for her to wear. She is the one that turned me on to these earbuds. These earbuds came with three sizes of soft ear cones, but only one hook.

I like that the Boloxa case tells you, with an easy to read digital display, exactly how much charge you have left. It charges quickly and works with all my wireless charging pads. It is really easy to pair with my Android phone. I used my earbuds everyday for 8 hours a day and I didn't need to charge my case for 4 days.

The box comes with the charging case, two earbuds, 3 size cone tips (one on the earbuds already), a USB to c charging cord, and a booklet of instructions. The instructions contain QR codes with videos to assist with adjusting the Android volume limits on your Android phone.

I like the sound quality and it is easy to adjust the volume with the earbuds only. The controls are simple, no need to learn morse code to advance a song or pause/play, and easy to use. They even work with only one earbud at a time.

As there is a microphone in both earbuds you can talk on the phone with only one in use. I would like to see some improvement with the microphone. My wife says this pair of earbuds sounds like I'm talking in a public bathroom, all echoes. The microphone picks up any and all surrounding noises and there is not a way to set the ambiance. It would be nice if they had an app like Sony earbuds do.

I really appreciate my wife turning me on to these. She really likes her pair of wired Boloxa U8I.

I just got my hands on the Boloxa A17 Bluetooth Earbuds and am pretty excited to have these as my day to day ear buds. If you're all about hassle-free sound, music and comfort, keep reading.

The wireless charging case is a bit bigger than others that I've had but it's actually a great thing because I no longer am I going to go digging through my bag for a small case that's fallen to the bottom. Not only does the case keep your earbuds safe but it also shows how much juice they've got left with a large digital display.

Now, sound quality. I put on my favorite playlists on spotify and was blown away. The sound is clear as day, with some serious bass punch. Whether you're into music, podcasting or simply watching TV shows, these buds deliver the fantastic sound. Battery life is pretty amazing as well. I wore these through a workout session as well as many hours of netflix and hulu episodes throughout the evening and they didn't even break a sweat. Perfect for long commutes or even binge-watching sessions.

Oh, and they're waterproof. Not like "Oops, it got wet" waterproof – we're talking IPXX7 waterproof. Rain or sweat, these earbuds can take it. I actually put these on in the pool and have hung out for several hours without an issue - they sound the same after the fact. Let's not forget about those ear hooks. The wraparound earhooks are a game-changer. They're comfy, and they stay put. Whether you're on a brisk walk, maybe even jogging or just chilling, these earbuds won't casually pop out of your ears, as many have for me.

So all in all, I have to say that the Boloxa A17 Bluetooth Earbuds are a great deal. They are easy to operate, can withstand a lot of wear and probably tear (with the way I use things) and appear super sleek on your head. Put it all together with the wireless charging case, killer sound, long battery life, and snug fit, they're a no-brainer. Upgrade your music listening or video watching game with these buds – you won't regret it.

I am not sure if I am like many people, but I have trouble finding a set of earbuds that I can use without them falling out of my ears. Maybe the holes in my ears are larger than most people but most earbuds fall out even if I cram them in, to the point they are uncomfortable, they end up coming out. I have had more success with over the ear headphones but the only ones I tried were wired. I have been looking for a quality set or wireless over the ear headphones that provide quality sound and won’t break the bank. I have found just that in the Boloxa A17 headset. When first opening the package, you can tell there has great care taken with this product. The packaging alone has the feel one would come to expect from much pricier products. The headset has a sleek design and are lightweight. The included instructions are clear and well thought out to show the use of all the features of the Boloxa A17 headset. I love the convenient features of this headset. Here are few noticeable features
• They turn on when you take them out of the case and turn off when you put them back in.
• They also stay in my ears comfortably and reliably no matter what angle my head may be in they stay snug and comfortable
• The case has wireless charging capability that works quite well. No need to reposition precisely in one location on a pad
• The buttons for control are large and easily useable even with large fingers.
• There is a charging indicator light on the outside of the case so you can tell it is charging and uses USB-C so I can use the same cable as my phone to charge them.
• The battery life of this headset it amazing. The case provides charge boost when not in use and a single case charge lasts for days.
If you have been looking for a quality over the ear wireless headset, I recommend you give these a try. I am quite certain you won’t be disappointed.

5.0 out of 5 stars Very comfortable, all-purpose earbuds
Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2023

I have been enjoying my new earbuds doing all kinds of activities for the past couple of weeks and I am truly impressed. These little guys not only meet but exceed my expectations in every aspect, making them a worthy investment for anyone looking for an inexpensive all-purpose pair of earbuds.
First, the sound quality of these earbuds is simply remarkable. Compared to my previous favorite headphones, these have a little extra goodness for my listening enjoyment. The bass is deep and resonant, while the treble is crisp and clear. Whether I’m listening to my favorite songs/podcasts, watching movies, or even taking phone calls, the audio quality is consistently impressive. The awesome L-to-R stereo sounds brings me back to the first time I heard AC/DC and Styx on my Sony Walkman.
Comfort is an important factor for me, and I'm pleased that these earbuds excel in this department. They come with two tip sizes, ensuring a snug fit. I use them as they came out of the box and have not experienced any discomfort. The lightweight design and sleek shape make them easy to wear while relaxing at home, working out, or running - without worrying I might drop one. They are also sweat and water-resistant.
They effortlessly work well with all my Bluetooth devices and the connection remains stable even from 10+ feet away, like when I run out to check the mail. The touch controls make it easy to adjust the volume, skip tracks or answer calls without reaching for my phone. And I really like the automatic reconnection when I take them out of the case.
Battery life is another area where these earbuds excel. With a single charge, I am able to enjoy hours of use. The charging case shows the % of life, fits well in my small purse and provides additional power when I can’t plug in.
With exceptional sound quality, comfort, connectivity, battery life, and low price, these definitely surpassed my expectations. They have certainly been a huge part of my daily routine, and I recommend them to anyone seeking a new pair or to give as a gift.

These headphones were very easy to work with. They came out of the box charged (both the headphones and the case). I turned them on and they immediately showed up on my phone as able to be paired to. They paired quickly to my phone. Sound quality seems good and they do a decent job of blocking off outside noise.
The headphones themselves fit well and were comfortable around the ears. It comes with three different ear pieces so you can find the right fit. I haven't worked out with them yet but it certainly seems like they won't go anywhere once you find the right ear piece.
The button press controls work well once you learn how to use them. It consistently paused my music when I wanted and started it back up on command. Volume control response is good. Calls also seem to come in clear.
Bluetooth range was decent but does get cut down quite a bit when there are obstacles between the headphones and the device (just the nature of bluetooth).
Now for what I think they could improve on:
1) They could have more fun color options. The only one that was available when I placed the order was black.
2) The last pair I had from this company had the capability to be paired to 2 different devices at the same time. They would play the audio from whichever device last started audio. For example, I would be listening to and watching my TV using the headphones. At the same time they were paired to my computer. So whenever I received an instant message or email, I would stop getting the audio from the TV and would get the chime from the computer. I found this to be a really handy feature. With these new headphones I can only be connected to one device at a time. So I have to go until my Bluetooth settings on my phone, disconnect the headphones, open up the settings on my computer, and connect the headphones in order to switch between my phone and my computer. So it is a bit more cumbersome.

Overall I would say these are a great purchase.

I have had numerous BT headphones of all sizes and styles. I consider myself a bit of an audiophile with a rather expensive theater in my living room (Dolby digital 7.1 with 1000+ watt Yamaha receiver and 7 Infinity speakers and Yamaha Powered sub). My vehicles all have upgraded custom audio as well. given that, I've not heard earphones with this level of dynamic range until getting into the $150-$200 range (Beats or Bose type equipment). I listen to a wide range of music (celtic, 80's-90's rock, Christian Rock, Gospel, Country, and a lot of Classical instrumental) and these provide deep bass and pretty clear highs.

I really love the over-the-ear design as they tend to stay fitted on my ear well even when being pretty active (I work in a shop and around a farm). They are comfortable after numerous hours of wearing.

As for user ease, they are very intuitive. I posted a picture of the instruction manual and with a button on each unit, you can increase volume or skip tracks very easily. They charge via USB C interface and a short cable is provided. There is a great digital display in the case to tell you remaining battery life in the base unit and when you drop each earphone into its slot, there is a battery level bar indicator that appears briefly to let you know the status of that headphone.

They have paired with my laptop, PC, and phone within 10 seconds of searching. And I found out today that the line of sight range (outdoors with phone on bench and me blowing leaves) is probably over 100 ft. (with no obstructions of course). Once I did get out of range and lost connection, there is a vocal alert in the phones to tell you that and as I came back closer to my phone, they rapidly re-connected.

Overall, these are reliable, easy to use and I feel unbeatable for the price.

I recently ordered the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones Stereo Sound for Sports. I was unsure about ordering them because they were different from what I usually use. I have never used ear buds with the loop that wraps around your ears and was a tad leery. These are now my favorite! The ear buds and loop are so comfortable. I almost forget I’m wearing them. The loops are not rigid, but very flexible and sit comfortably on my ears. The buds I normally wear are loop less but more rigid and become uncomfortable after wearing them for a few hours. The Boloxa A17 can be worn for hours without irritation. They do not unexpectedly pop out of my ear during use, either. I’m no longer having to look all over for earbuds that decided to fall out of my ear.

Not only are they comfortable, but the sound is also fantastic! The bass is phenomenal. Sometimes I only use one bud while I’m at work. The sound is still great! The button controls on the buds make it easy to operate the different functions of the buds. If someone walks in and I must have a conversation with someone I just tap the button and it pauses. Phone calls are clear and easy to answer as well.

The charge lasts for a long time. I can get about 8 hours of use out of one charge. If I wear only one bud, I can get double the time. I switch them out when one bud needs charging. The case is also very nice. I don’t have to plug the case in to charge every day. Normally, I can get 3 days out of one charge.

I plan to order another pair of the of the Boloxa A17 so I have a pair at work and a pair for home. I’m highly satisfied with this purchase. I have not found a better set of earbuds at this price point.

I have been using these for about a week now. The sound quality is better than the other ear buds I have tried in this price range.
Overall physical construction quality of the ear buds and case/charger are good. Flush buttons on the ear buds blend in seamlessly. The ear buds fit into the case easily, even with the ear hooks and sync up to charge every time. The ear hooks on the buds are flexible and comfortable. They also really help to keep them in place when working out and moving around. This allows you to not need to push them into your ear canals as tightly, but still stay in place. That makes them more comfortable for me, especially when working out.
The bluetooth syncing was quick and the signal is strong. I can go to the other side of my house and leave my phone in the other room and the connection stays strong. Latency is low.
The case charges the ear buds quickly, and I like the indicators for the individual ear buds charging as well as the charge level of the battery in the case - handy! The battery in the case also charges quickly - even via USB plugged into a laptop. Battery life of both the ear buds themselves and the case are also good. I was able to charge the ear buds several times (didn't count) before needing to charge the case again.
Sound quality is good both for podcasts and music with good bass level for ear buds - better than other ear buds I have used.
The buttons on the ear buds are flush and work well for the controls syncing to my phone.
Delivery was quick - had them in 2 days with Prime.
Overall I am very satisfied with these ear buds, especially at this price point! I would buy them again.

These headphones are great. I was never sure that I would like the Earbuds that wrap around my ears. But these are extremely comfortable. I did use the larger tips. (A set of three is included) The fit was surprisingly comfortable. I like the feel much better than my others that are supposed to magically stay put in my ears. These stay comfortably and snuggly attached to the ear. No more having them fall out while exercising. The control is great because there are easy to find physical push buttons which means you cannot accidentally touch the wrong spot and have the music stop or change. Quite easy to answer incoming phone calls with these as well. The sound performance is particularly good. If you get them sealed in your ears correctly there is a full range of bass and clear highs. The seal does create a seal which suppresses noise. I used them in the pool for a workout and they worked fine. They do last a long time on a charge. I have never used them long enough for them to need recharging during a full day. They recharge easily in the case which has a clear display, and it has a built-in battery to charge on the go when necessary. I am not sure how many recharges there are in the case before it needs recharging. The case recharges with an included USB-C cable. There is a Flashing LED that shows until charged. My set is black as pictured. The size is palm sized. It is easy to hold on to them and they will easily fit in your pocket or purse. They were quite easy to pair with my phone. They are in pairing mode when taken out of the case the first time. Their construction is very solid, and they should last a long time. I highly recommend these headphones - especially for the price!!!!

These headphones have great sound quality for the price. Do not expect audiophile level sounds, but for the average user these headphones sound great! They fit snugly in the ear and even include different ear tips in case you need a different size. The sports wing tips that go around your ear make these super convenient for exercising since you know the headphones will not pop out of your ear like some other headphone brands that only barely stick in your ear. I was looking for a solution since my previous pair of Bluetooth headphones would fall off when I’m working around the house and I didn’t want to have to deal with something around the neck that feels heavy or gets in the way.
I also appreciate the buttons on both headphones that allow some more intricate controls (you can go to the previous track using your left ear instead of having to press at least 3 times – which with my previous headphones I feel like never registers correctly.) Additionally, it’s nice since you can pair each headphone separately if needed in mono mode and still control it with a button on either. I like to do this when working around the house or at a coffee shop so I can hear family or friends if they are calling for me.
Lastly, the headphones case is a great upgrade for me. I love the display that shows how much battery you actually have left instead of having to guess or just always plugging it in – it also shows you if the headphones are charging or not which is convenient. Lastly, the best part is that the case can wirelessly charge now! I’m sick of every new electronic needing a new cable and having to keep track of all of them or use up my phone charging cable – nice to be able to just set it on a wireless charger and leave it there!

I ordered and received these headphones with great anticipation. Not to belittle the rest of this review, but I really like these headphones. A lot of it for reasons of personal taste as well.
Not a lot of people will be too particular about the button on the sides of them; but let me tell you, there is a big difference between having to press something very hard into your ear for it to register, and to just lightly touch it. A lot of times with more carelessly designed headphones the earbud will straight up press a sharp point into your inner ear (ouch).
These headphones have been designed to where the pressure spreads out all three your ear, and the result is that it is barely a pressure felt from using the button. Also, I preferred the precision of a button over the and precise happenstance of the touch button was features so popular now (the only reason I can see for designing them that way is that it is easier for them to be made waterproof). These also are waterproof without having to rely on that negative item.
Okay, now for the more basic stuff. The sound is very good. It’s so good to the point that I may attach them to my monitor and use them just for watching stuff online (I’m not so worried about the sound quality on watching YouTube videos and music and such). But if you want to know one thing about these headphones, you cannot ask for better sound for the price.
The battery life is fine. It does not say in the instructions or anything, but is about eight hours at maximum volume. I did not time it or anything like that. So please do your own research.
In a final analysis, these are excellent headphones for the money. I’m not sure about how many recharges in the charger container, but just by the sides of it, it should be a great deal of them.

The Boloxa Wireless Sports headphones arrived just a few days after I placed the order. The box it came in was well packaged, and it had a complete user manuel with all the information, warnings and instructions, and the entire thing was in English. Some product inserts have very little information, and they are in so many different languages, there isn't space to say much in English, so I really appreciated having an entire printed booklet come with the headphones. After reading the instructions and taking them out of the box, I turned them on and they paired immediately with my iPhone. I tested the volume of both speakers, and I could only turn it up about halfway as the sound is so good and clear that any higher would have been too loud.

The appearance is very sleek, and though I have never owned earbuds/headphones that wrapped around the ear, I was delighted by how comfortable they were to use, despite having a number of ear piercings (see photo). I went about my day, enjoying listening to music and videos while I did laundry and washed dishes. Despite being used for several consecutive hours, the battery remained mostly full. When I placed them back in the case, they were charged to full again in less than an hour. Awesome! When I ordered these headphones, I didn't expect to love them as much as I do, which is somewhat unfortunate for me, as I have already promised them to my 21 year old son. Ah well, I guess I can always order another set for myself, and at the current price of $29.99 I feel they are very good value for money. I have already owned a set of earbuds from this company for some time (they look like airpods), so I know they make good, quality products that last. I absolutely recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for good value for their money, and who wants a product that will last. Five stars, all the way!

Let me start off by saying that I am a 72 year old man who is moderately functional with technology. I have always had a problem with earbud type headphones. They either fall out easily or do not usually feel comfortable. As a result I have always used over the ear headphones. During Prime Days I came across some earbud type blue tooth headphones at a great price and decided to give them a try. I really liked them. They fit well and were more comfortable than the over the ear set I have when listening for a long period of time. I still had a concern about them coming out if I were moving about, so I decided to try these wrap around headphones. I absolutely love them! They are very comfortable and give the added security that I wanted. They stay in place no matter what activity I do. I'm not an audiophile, but the sound quality to me is fantastic whether listening to music or podcasts. They are not noise cancelling, but they certainly block out normal distracting sounds while still allowing you to hear anything that you need to be alerted to. The longest I have worn them is 4 hours so I cannot say if they would work for someone who needs to use them for longer stretches. I have used them daily for well over a week and am just now charging them for the first time so they have good longevity on a charge. They connect easily to my iPhone, iPad, and Grace Digital internet radio. Some people may feel the need to spend a lot more money to get the highest sound quality possible, but these are more that adequate for the average user and the price for what you get is phenomenal.

I purchased the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones Stereo Sound for Sports, first let me tell you the design is very comfortable, lightweight and ergonomic, fits well for ears is that all you need during workouts.
If you fit the earphones tightly in your ears, you can enjoy excellent quality bass sound, which allows you to reduce outside noise. Microphone is very good too, when I make a call, the other person hear me strong and clear
Battery life is amazing and the battery charge is very fast too, battery life indicator is very useful, show it the battery charge percentage, this is really excellent because allows me to know how much charge I have. In addition to that, it has two charging systems: Type-C charging and Wireless Charging.
Bluetooth connection is very easy and quickly, BOLOXA A17 has many functions, which makes it more efficient like answer call, end call, reject call, next track, previous track, play or pause, volume up, volume down for song or videos YouTube, another good function is when you put it in your ears, audio system tells you “Power on, connected”
The headphones have a good range, between my devices and the headphones, I have tested it up to 5 meters away. Material quality is very resistant, I have dropped many times and headphones are ok. I can use only the right headphone on and it works without the need to have both in my ears, so my left ear can be free to be aware of my surroundings
I have connected it to many devices such as my iPhone, Apple TV, Android phone and on my Windows 11 Laptop and it has been compatible with all of them, without any problem, pairing was quickly.
My advice, if you are looking for quality, comfort and good price this is the best choice that I have found and used.

I'm a fan of wireless headphones. I recently bought a pair of these new Boloxa wireless headphones. These are my second pair that I buy for sporting purposes. I've been using them for a few weeks and they are very effective. They fit easily in the ear, it's easy to wear and control these. the battery lasts a long time. They are excellent for doing any sport, especially jogging, since they remain fixed and do not fall off.
The delivery time was indicated by the supplier, there were no delays.
I tried them for the first time with my Xiaomi cell phone and they connected right away, then I did it with my daily use laptop and they also paired quickly. Very easy when answering calls, raising or lowering the volume, its use is friendly. The music also sounds very good. These headphones have buttons on the sides that facilitate their use when exercising. They are also firm headphones, that is, they fit the ear and do not fall out easily. Regarding the sound, I am not an expert on this subject, but I understand that it is good, it is not heard with interruptions. The charging case is practical since it has a screen that indicates the percentage of battery charge that the headphones have. The best thing about these headphones is that they are type c cable and fast when charging. In addition, the battery is long lasting. Also the case is fast charging.

Part of the accessories is that it comes with a small usb cable for charging and some pairs of ear pads.

Another benefit in favor is that they are resistant to water, perhaps not for long.

They are perfect for daily use, work and exercising. I recommend them for personal use or as a nice gift.

These headphones are great! I haven't used fully wireless headphones before, so it's a whole new experience for me. The sound is great, I can't hear outside noises very well while listening, which is great. A lot of headphones that are on the cheaper side don't have sound quality like these do. I also tested the range of the headphones to see if I could go into other rooms and still be connected to the device. I've had other devices where I could go a certain distance and be okay, but one step too far and it's disconnected. These headphones haven't had that issue, I can walk all around my house and the sound is crystal clear. I'm excited for these headphones, and to see how they will hold up. So far the battery life is excellent and have not needed to charge them after multiple long uses. I love that they have a case to store them in and that I can charge them in so they don't get dirty and they are handy to grab and throw into my purse. Bonus for these is no chord, so they can not get tangled or get lost within my purse because of the case. It is super helpful. Tonight I used the headphones to watch a show while doing dishes. With headphones in the past I would have to pause my show while I rinsed the dishes because I couldn't hear what was going on. The water completely drowned out the sound of the headphones. But tonight, things were completely different. These headphones keep the noise level outside quiet enough that I didn't have to blare the volume or pause my show to be able to hear it. Super solid headphones and very worth the price! I would highly recommend them.

Well my earbuds showed up today which I’m super stoked about because the earbuds I am currently using while working fit in my ears but they aren’t snug.. so I ordered these in hopes they will fulfill my issue I’m currently having.

I have to say that these earbuds immediately paired with my iPhone 14 😁 after having them paired I quickly put these on my ears and they slid right on and then in went the ear piece and you know the feeling when you have an exact fit 🥳 🤠 I knew off the muscle these are gonna be the ones that do me right… after doing this and having my extreme feeling of satisfaction I went to my pandora app where my music kicked on out went all the outside noise and in went some kick ass music.. I have to say I truly think these are gonna be the best buds I’ve ever owned..
I went through all the prompts that the instructions manual informed me of.. one push to stop the music one push to stop the music then a punch and hold to turn the volume up and down

Considering these are a fraction of the price of the major retailers ear buds I have to say I am super impressed and so excited that I now have a set that will stay put in my ears and that sound amazing!

If you looking at the reviews and run across mine just know I’m telling the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me god! 😂 naw seriously get these ear buds they are freaking awesome and they come with different ear size rubber pieces for the smaller and bigger holes!

I recently purchased the Boloxa A17 wireless headphones, and I must say, they left me thoroughly impressed. These headphones are nothing short of phenomenal, offering a fantastic audio experience coupled with impressive features that are hard to believe at such an affordable price point.

One of the standout features of the Boloxa A17 is its wide and balanced frequency response. Whether you're a fan of bass-heavy beats or prefer the crisp clarity of high notes, these headphones deliver an exceptional audio performance across the entire sound spectrum. The sound quality is rich, immersive, and highly satisfying, making it an absolute joy to listen to music, podcasts, or any other audio content.

Battery life is another area where the Boloxa A17 truly shines.

You no longer have to worry about running out of battery midway through your workout or daily routine. The convenience of such extended battery life is truly commendable.

One common frustration with wireless headphones is the fear of them falling out and getting lost. However, the Boloxa A17 comes with an ingenious design that addresses this concern. These headphones are anchored securely to your ears, ensuring a snug fit and eliminating the risk of them slipping off during exercise or vigorous activities. This feature alone sets them apart from many other wireless headphones on the market.

The inclusion of a charging case with a battery life indicator and charging status further enhances the overall user experience. This handy addition allows you to keep track of the remaining battery life of both the headphones and the case itself, ensuring that you never run out of power unexpectedly. It's a small but thoughtful detail that adds convenience and peace of mind.

One aspect that left me astounded was the affordability of the Boloxa A17. Given the exceptional audio quality, long-lasting battery life, and secure fit, it's hard to fathom how they manage to manufacture such an outstanding product at such a reasonable price point. It's a testament to the brand's commitment to providing value to its customers without compromising on quality.

In conclusion, the Boloxa A17 wireless headphones are a remarkable choice for anyone seeking a phenomenal audio experience, extended battery life, secure fit, and convenience. The wide and balanced frequency response ensures an enjoyable listening experience across all genres of music, while the long-lasting battery eliminates the hassle of frequent recharging.

I've absolutely loved them so the A17 model seemed like a perfect upgrade. The sound profile of my old headphones is rich and full. They turn on when you take them out of the case and turn off when you put them back in. They also stay in my ears reliably.

When I heard about the A17 model, I became interested in having an option that wraps around my ear for even better security during exercise. Even though the B16s stay in fairly well, I have to adjust them and push them in every now and then to make sure they aren't going to fall out. The A17 model felt like a good option for going running and extended use so I went ahead and bought them to try out.

The A17s have just arrived and I'm really happy to find the same quality sound that I love from my B16 headphones. I seriously don't understand why anyone would pay more money for bluetooth headphones when you can get this kind of rich sound out of something so accessibly priced. They A17 headphones have buttons on them that allow for more control (volume, skipping a track, answering a call and more) without having to interact with your phone or whatever the headphones are connected to. It's going to take me a while to memories the controls (press twice for next track, long press for volume change, press both to answer a call etc.) Once it's in my head I think I will have a lot of fun with this feature but it is a little tricky to master at first.

This is my first pair of headphones that hug the ear like these do, and they are quite comfortable. I always worried that they would scratch or squeeze my ear but I can barely feel them when they are on.

The only way to turn off my old headphones is to return them to the case. This means that if I forgot my case somewhere far, I have to just let the batteries run down. I don't have this issue with the new A17 headphones! All I have to do is press the button on both ears for 5 seconds and they will turn off so I don't have to find the case to keep them from running out of battery. Im really excited to have both the A16 and 17 headphones at my disposal now. They both have their advantages and I foresee me being able to use these for a long time.

Been trying out many, many different sports-oriented wireless earbuds over the past two years (occiam, apekx, okeefe, Tozo, etc., you name it). Over numerous disappointments and many frustrating experiences, took a flyer on this relatively new product and I’m very glad I did. Across all the ones I’ve tried in this price range, this one by far is the best. A few highlights below:

1) Sound quality is up there even against mainstream brand products that that boast noise-canceling features such as Beats and Skull Candy (by the way, way overrated). Music is crisp, podcasts are clear and it responds quite well when I was toying around with equalizer apps on my phone. No issues with phone calls even in crowded public spaces.

2) Connection is easy and reliable. Unlike my experience with Tozo and a few others, these don’t randomly disconnects or goes to “Pause”. It also offers a very decent range – I can easily walk from my desk down the hallway to the other side and very rarely do I lose connection.

3) Battery life is quite amazing. Instead of having to charge every other night before going to bed, these can easily last me almost and entire week just using the case to charge during showers and meetings. I pretty much wear them all the time – during my commute, at work, in gyms, out running errands, etc.

4) The earpieces are very comfortable to wear all day, and unlike a few others do not fall off. I also very much appreciate the big, round buttons controls on the side. They are easy to reach / find, do not require much effort to press, and most importantly not based on touch sensors where I can accidentally drop a call or stop a track when I’m just making slight adjustments or taking one side off.

5) This is one of the very few models that come with wireless charging, and it works quite well. No need to frequently adjust the positioning to make it work.

The only improvement I wish for is a slight tweak in design so the battery / charging display is on the outside of the case. Other than that, I’m extremely satisfied and do plan on gifting this true gem to friends and family this Christmas season.

One last note…for these type of everyday use earbuds, anything IPX 5 / IPX 6 or above is more than adequate (and this is IPX 7). Paying more for IPX 8 is total overkill and not worth the extra costs.

5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Bluetooth Headphones for Running

I recently purchased these Bluetooth headphones, and I must say they have exceeded all my expectations! As an avid runner, finding the perfect pair of headphones that stay in place, sync effortlessly, and remain comfortable throughout my workouts has been a challenge. However, these headphones have completely changed the game for me.

The first thing that impressed me was the snug and secure fit. They come with multiple ear tips, allowing me to choose the perfect size that fits my ears perfectly. No matter how intense my runs get, these headphones stay firmly in place, eliminating any worries of them falling out or needing constant readjustments.

Syncing these headphones with my phone was a breeze. The Bluetooth connectivity is exceptionally stable, and the pairing process is almost instantaneous. No more frustrating connection dropouts during my workouts; it's just smooth, uninterrupted music to keep me motivated and focused.

Comfort is a crucial factor for me during extended runs, and I couldn't be happier with the lightweight design and soft ear tips of these headphones. Even during long-distance runs, I forget I'm wearing them, as they don't cause any discomfort or irritation.

The sound quality is fantastic, delivering clear, crisp audio with deep bass that energizes my runs. The noise isolation is impressive too, effectively blocking out distractions from my surroundings.

Overall, I highly recommend these Bluetooth headphones to any fellow runners or fitness enthusiasts. They offer an impeccable fit, seamless syncing, and unbeatable comfort, making them the ultimate companion for your workout sessions. Get ready to elevate your running experience with these remarkable headphones!

5.0 out of 5 stars An ideal blend of function, form, and performance in a budget-friendly package

The A17-series earbuds have clearly blended the best of prior models into a clean and well-functioning successor. Right out of the box, the quality shows with the case, which supports both wireless and USB-C charging, permits easy removal of the earbuds, and has a very nice heft & snap. The earbuds themselves are extremely comfortable, fit securely even during vigorous exercise, and paired straight-away. The new Bluetooth 5.3 chipset shows demonstrable advantages over the previous 4.0 standard with noticeably faster reconnection and reception - where an older BT4-based earbud would drop out due to distance or obstruction, the A17s keep going. I've been very happy with the sound quality - from audiobooks to classical to hard-hitting workout tracks, the audio came through clearly and with a full spectrum; you may want to swap the silicone earbud shields with one of the other sizes to tailor the fit, which allows for even better noise isolation and bass response. The headphone controls have a satisfying mechanical click, and are cleanly responsive. The true-wireless buds also synchronize nearly insantly when worn together, but function just as well when wearing a single earpiece at a time. The battery life is also fantastic - I get an entire day from the earbuds alone, and the case will charge them many times over!

Bottom line, if you're looking for robust sound & performance in a well-designed and comfortable package, and need something that is secure during physical activity, the A17 earbuds are a very easy choice that is just as easy on your wallet.

5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable, great sounding headphones that actually stay in my ears
Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2023

After buying various in-ear headphones for walking/running, I've finally found a pair of headphones that doesn’t fall out of my ears! The over the ear clips are the key to keeping the headphones in place, and yet they are still comfortable to wear. I don’t even feel the clips, and the headphones are easy to put in and take out. I’m pretty sure my left ear hole is smaller than my right, and with other headphones even using the smaller earpiece in my left ear would still cause that earbud to fall out. But not with these headphones and the over the ear clip.

The sound quality of these headphones is excellent too, especially the bass, which can be difficult to get in this type of headphones. Usually I look to the over the ear headphones for good bass, but for exercising that’s a bit too bulky and leads to unwanted ear sweat. These headphones do a terrific job of reproducing all the highs and lows you'd want to hear.

I experienced no problems pairing the Bluetooth headphones with my Android phone and my Ubuntu Linux computer. The range is as good as any other Bluetooth devices I use – all of course depending on the Bluetooth adapter in your device and any physical obstructions in between.

While I haven’t had the headphones long enough to see how the batteries hold up long term, I can say that they hold a charge for a very long time. The digital display on the case that shows the remaining battery percentage is a nice touch, too, as are the multicolored lights on the earbuds themselves that show the connectivity status. A reasonable length USB charging cable is included, as are the different size earpieces. The button on the side works well for pausing or skipping tracks. I can’t say I’ve wanted to test just how waterproof these are, but they are advertised to be IPX7 waterproof, so I guess we’ll see if I encounter any wet weather in the near future and I’ll report back if I do. The charging case makes these ear buds super portable. I’m unlikely to even need the charging cable to plug them in when going on trips.

In conclusion, this is a quality pair of headphones all around, and for the price it’s an obvious choice. Pick one up – you’ll be glad you did!

It's perfect for quick adjustments during my workouts, allowing me to stay focused and in the zone.

Overall, these wireless earbuds have exceeded my expectations in every aspect. They are an excellent choice for gym enthusiasts who demand durability, exceptional sound, and user-friendly controls.

These are, by far, the most fantastic ear buds I have ever owned and worth every single penny! They are so comfortable I can sleep with them in (back sleeping), they stay exactly where I want them throughout an entire workout, the sound quality is phenomenal, the noise cancel mode is stellar, and the transparency mode is exactly what you'd want for it. Not to mention the color - I adore the color! I cannot recommend these earbuds loud enough! You don't even know what you're missing without them! I rarely write reviews of products, and for anyone like me, who is always a little suspicious of over the top reviews - this is NOT a paid review, I was not asked for a review, I bought these with my own money, and I came back on the website myself to sing these praises. You won't be disappointed. Whether you're in a noisy gym or a crowded cafe, tune out and focus on your tunes with ease. These Earbuds use some seriously smart tech to detect and cancel external noise. So go ahead, transport yourself to a world of pure audio bliss, with not a peep from the outside world to distract you. Designed to fit seamlessly into your active lifestyle - and your ears. With the ergonomic gel fin design, these earbuds offer unbeatable comfort. The gel tips ensure you can listen for hours without fatigue. No matter the intensity these will beat it.

I bought this item (Boloxa A17) for working out, walking/biking/weight lifting. I wanted a push button control vs touch sensitive control. I have earbuds with sensitive touch control and it’s a pain to get it to work the way you want it to, this product (Boloxa A17) works and sounds great and you can easily adjust the volume up and down with ease. When needed you can also fast-forward or go back to songs with ease. The buttons on each ear piece makes it easy to control what you need it to do without the worry of trying to fumble around and push the wrong buttons. Very easy to adjust volume and change tracks on your music selection and answering and making calls. You also have two ways of charging, usb-c and wireless charging, which works great for my setup. I’ve worn these for up to 4 hours at a time with no issue as far as it hurting my ear canal or losing power. I like the way it hooks around the ear, it’s secure and I have no issues with it falling out. As for waterproof IPX67, I would say they definitely have been soaked from the use I’ve put them through including rinsing them off under the water spigot for cleaning and show no signs of failure. I would buy this product again!

I ride an average of 400 miles a month. I need sports headphones that are TOUGH, that have enough battery for a 100 KM ride, that stay in my ears over the most challenging terrain, that provide high quality sound so that whatever I play, I can hear it clearly. The BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones excel in every one of these requirements. Yesterday I finished a 60 mile gravel ride. These headphones performed like magic. For the first hour and a half I listened to the Eric Metaxas biography of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Didn't miss a word. For the rest of the ride I listened to my Grateful Dead channel. The base midrange and treble were ALL delivered with great fidelity. The batteries were still operating after nearly 3 hours and the earbuds stayed in and delivered without blocking the surrounding sounds which is a great safety factor. It was nearly 100 degrees by the end and I was dripping with sweat but the WATERPROOF earphones continued to operate, unbothered by the sweat. These earphones did everything I could possibly ask of them, delivered terrific quality sound and remained comfortable for the entire ride. If you are looking for world class sound that is reliable and long lasting, I have never experienced anything better. Get yourself a pair of BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones. They may be the last sport earphones you ever buy!!

I may have odd shaped ears because up until I received the A17 model, I've never been able to wear earbuds and have them stay in place in my ear. Especially when I exercise, which is primarily when I wear the earbuds. In addition to not moving in my ear, the next thing I noticed was the sound quality. Very impressive! I'm not an expert but we all know when something sounds either good or off just a bit. These sound good at both ends of the scale. I used to travel every week for years and at the time I purchased a pair of very expensive noise cancelling over the ears head phones. They worked wonderfully for years, until one day they just quit working. I can't say the A17's work as well as the over the ear model I wore on an airplane (because I have no plans to be on an airplane) but they seem to work as well in the gym where there is always background noise.
Overall I'm very impressed with the quality, both sound and fit, and would highly recommend the A17 Headphones. Especially for the price! They are comparable to my old over the ear model that cost over ten times as much!

The microphone is great and I can hear calls very clearly. Having earphones where you don't have to continue to put them on a charger multiple times throughout the day is a plus. I can go hours upon hours without having to recharge these earphones when listening to music, YouTube, or a podcast. Another cool feature is the transmission range. I can leave my phone upstairs and still hear my music clearly downstairs, this is awesome.

I have a pair of Bose QC35s and love them, but definitely not gym headphones and wanted something small but would not fall out of my ear when I am on equipment. I tried the type you insert into the ear but those never really fit well and would always fall out. So started my search for a different type of bluetooth headphones to use at the gym and around town. Had a list of requirements: 1. Needed to be compact and the fit on my ear, 2. The sound quality and battery life. Stumbled on these and was very curious as this hit a majority of the requirements from what I can tell so decided to give them a try.
Was very impressed on the quality and battery life when I received them. Definitely not Bose but I really do not mind using these at the gym, around town or even when doing yard work. They have a loop that make them stay put on my ear and come with different size ear pieces to make sure they fit snug in your ear. They never fell off while running on the treadmill which was a big concern with the Apple style ones for me.
Besides the initial charge for 100% when I received them I have not had to charge them up. Been using them at the gym for about a week for 6-8 hours and outside while doing yard work (I did initially charge them to 100% before using). They are light and at times forget I am wearing them.
I was telling my wife about them the other day and she tried them on and liked them a lot as well. Noticed the headphones go missing only to find them in my wife’s gym bag!!! She doesn’t want to give them up. Haha. Will definitely order another pair. For the value cannot go wrong.

These headphones are at a really good price point for the great quality. The sound quality is very nice with good lows and vocals. They have a very comfortable fit, especially I usually don’t like the type that go in your ear like these do but they don’t cause discomfort. So far the battery life is very impressive, been listening to them all day and doesn’t even seem like the battery has gone down at all. The case is relatively compact and can obviously charge them even more so realistically don’t even know when I will have to charge them. I tested them out with a phone call and they worked great. I like more sleek ones for day to day but like they advertise they are great for workout with the wrap around the ear. Can run or move around at the gym and not always having to adjust them or have them fall out. They don’t rub the back of your ears so I started not to notice them while working on stuff. For the price point they really are great headphones, obviously better exist out there if you are wanting to pay a ton of money but for me these are great.

The A17 headphones are a good value at this price point. In the photos you can see everything that comes in the package as well as what they look like after you remove the little plastic piece that blocks charging when you receive them. The exterior look and feel is similar to the G17s but the sound quality is noticably better. They also share the only downside of the product, being that there is no active noise canceling so I wouldn't recommend them for calls if you have a noisy background. However, at this price point, the sound quality is quite good and I recommend them if you're just wanting to use them for listening to music or audiobooks while doing chores around the house or working out at the gym. The headphones have a nice feel going over the ear and I didn't have any issues with them while I was running on the treadmill. I was also listening to an audiobook for several hours while I was mowing the lawn and the headphones lasted the entire time. Overall, the quality of the A17s are on par with some headphones I've had in the $50-$100 range but are sold for much less. I would recommend them for anyone who is looking for a decent set of headphones for a lower price point.

I gave the Boloxr A17 Wireless Sport Headphones a shot, and I'm genuinely impressed. The sound quality is spot-on – not too heavy on the bass like my Beats headphones. The noise cancellation feature works like a charm, helping me stay focused on my music and videos without any disturbances.

What amazed me was how long the battery held up – they powered through the entire day while I listened to my music all day and watched some videos in between. Comfort-wise, they've got it right. The different attachments ensure a snug fit that feels tailor-made.
One thing I really appreciate is the ear hook design – it gives a secure fit, so I don't have to worry about them slipping off while I'm on the move.

Considering the price, I'd say these headphones are a smart buy. I'm more than satisfied with my purchase and would definitely consider getting another pair in the future.

If you're looking for reliable wireless sport headphones that sound great and feel comfy? Definitely get these! Honestly, out of all my headphones, from high-end to cheap, these are honestly in my top three, no cap 🧢 lol! Had to slip that in.
Edit: had an issue with one of the ear pieces not charging and they refunded me and sent me a replacement pair. Will definitely just from them again.

Last week I bought the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones, and I am very surprised with my choice. These headphones have met all of my expectations from the company and even exceeded them. In comparison to other headphones and also the price, this would be the best choice if you are looking for a headphone with excellent quality.
The headphones are very comfortable to see. They fit any shape of ears and I can wear them during running and cycling without any problem. The sound quality is unbelievable and it also has noise cancellation which works perfectly.
The battery life is also excellent. Usually for my concentration, I listen to music in my office and I used these headphones for around 7 hours without recharging. This is impressive I asked my friend about the battery life and he told me that after a long time of using these headphones, the battery health is like the first day. They support fast charging.
In summary, I am extremely content with my acquisition of the BOLOXR Wireless Sports Headphones. They deliver on their promises of elegant design, comfort, and enduring battery life. If you're looking for wireless headphones, I strongly suggest giving these a shot.

What an excellent pair of headphones! I’ve had many many pairs of headphones over the years, what can I say, I’m not interested in paying $200 plus for AirPods just to have them fall out of my ears while I’m skiing or biking. Anyways, I’m so impressed with these headphones! They come at a budget price point which was very important to me. If I lose them it’s not really a big deal. Been using them for about a week and they’re checking all the boxes. Connected easily to all of my devices. They wrap around the ear so they’re on and secured even during vigorous movement and exercise. Sound quality is very good as is the noise cancellation. This is a small thing probably more “me” than other users but I LOVE that these headphones have a physical button for pause/skip/siri. I think the physical button is infinitely superior to the touch tech button. I never have to wonder if I touched it enough times or the right way.

Long story short, these are excellent and economical wireless headphones. If you have gotten this far in reading my review, just buy them already, you won’t regret it!

I was afraid to buy another set of earbuds from Amazon because I recently purchased a popular brand of earbuds from Amazon, and they came to me damaged, unable to charge, and these were very, very pricey earbuds.
Fast forward a bit after my refund and I decided to look for water resistant earbuds as well as noise cancelling. These were the first ones to come up, and for the price, I had to check the reviews, read the stats, and check on the battery life.

It is day one of having these earbuds and so far, so good. Great sound -As a musician the sound is very important and so far it drowns out my fan, but also sounds like high quality as if you were at the concert of the artists. Great job overall. I don't know about water resistant yet or anything else, but the sound and battery plus the sleek design of the case and the box it came in make me give this 5 stars for sure. Hope this helps :-) I go through earbuds like they are pairs of socks so I am impressed so far -

Pairs easily; open charging box and remove the earpieces and they immediately go in pairing mode or connect. I've tried other headphones with charging cases and they would pair or connect to your bluetooth device as soon as you open the charging case. I prefer the way these work where you actually have to remove them from the case first.

Sound is good, not the best, but pretty good. I'd prefer a bit more base, but just a personal preference.

Controls are easy and intuitive. One button on the left and right earpieces.

I ran with them earlier and they worked well. One issue I've had with other wireless bluetooth earbuds is that they would get out of sync and one side would stop working. While running with these, they did seem to go out of sync for a split second, but then they would reconnect immediately. Hardly even noticeable. Problem may be with my phone though.

Overall I'm pleased with these so far.

I have tried many sets of headphones, and these are my favorite so far! They sit comfortably on your ears and have a hook around the earlobe, and in my point of view, the best part is they do not come off with movement and exercise. The sound quality is amazing. I also like the charging case that they come in. It is high quality and sturdy and shows the percent charge of each headphone. The headphones also charge while in the case, and there is a USB cable to plug in and charge the case itself. I appreciate the ability to control your sound tracks and volumes by pressing on the button of the headphone. It is easy to pair the headphones with your device by using the Bluetooth option, and your device automatically finds the headphones. Lastly, the item comes with a booklet with very clear instructions, as well as two different sets of earbuds you can choose from. I highly recommend these!

I just got my A17 headphones and couldn't wait to go on my morning run to try them out. Wow! Wow! Wow! The fit is incredible, and I don't feel like I have earbuds on at all. They're incredibly light weight and have a beautiful full rich sound with bass tones coming through. I've been a fan of Boloxa earbuds which I've always loved but this wireless model steps it up not one notch but a dozen.

Now I can see with the charging case exactly when I need to recharge but it really isn't necessary because when you store them, they automatically begin recharging. The wireless charging case is sturdy and solid, and I can just lay the charging case on my wireless charging puck. It's so easy and no fumbling to plug in wires.

I recently purchased the BOLOXR Wireless Sports Headphones and I must say, I'm thrilled with my decision. Having been impressed with the results of their previous wired version, I was eager to try out their wireless offering. And I'm glad I did. These headphones are everything I expected from the company and more.

First and foremost, the sleek design caught my attention. They have a modern and stylish look that I absolutely love. But it's not just about aesthetics; these headphones are also incredibly comfortable. I can wear them for extended periods without feeling any discomfort or irritation.

The battery life is another standout feature. I've been using these headphones on the treadmill for about a week now, with each session lasting close to 30 minutes, and I haven't had to charge them yet. The long-lasting battery is a huge plus for me, as I don't have to worry about running out of power during my workouts.

One thing worth mentioning is that the case is a bit heavier than I expected. However, for someone like me who tends to lose things easily, this actually works in my favor. The weight makes it less likely for me to misplace the case, so I consider it a positive aspect.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the BOLOXR Wireless Sports Headphones. They deliver on their promises of sleek design, comfort, and long-lasting battery life. If you're in the market for wireless headphones, I highly recommend giving these a try.

I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for high-quality yet affordable earbuds. The design and practicality of the earbuds are perfect for everyday wear. Over the last week, I’ve used them all throughout school, in public, and while riding my bike. While the earbuds were secure, the over-the-ear piece was comfortable and didn’t make my ear sore over time, as I have experienced with similar earbuds. The audio quality is impressive, especially for the price, and I haven’t had any problems with audio leaking out of the earbuds when on higher volume. The case holds a charge along with the earbuds, so I haven’t had to charge them frequently or at inconvenient times. Because of the case’s power display, I haven’t had them lose power in public where I was unable to charge them as I have with other earbuds and headphones. Overall, I have been extremely pleased with both the company and the quality of their products.

Sometimes all you need are the fundamentals, and that’s where these earbuds manage to rise above the crowded field of sub-$50 competition. Their sound puts some emphasis on the bass but still manages to come through nicely balanced overall with very good clarity for this price range.

The earbuds last for up to seven hours of continuous playback, and the compact case holds three additional charges. Their large physical buttons are easy to use, and the earbuds fit snugly with the loops for all sizes of ears (tried on 3 different people with different tips).

This is my 3rd pair (different models) of Boloxa headphones and I am continued to be amazed at the quality of products they offer for a fraction of the price of name brands. Tested them under different conditions (running, walking and workouts) and they stay in place because of the loops which are quite comfortable.

Great headphones for the price.

First I have killed 5 pairs of earbuds. I am a sweaty gym rat. It is easy for moisture to get trapped in some. So far I am pleased with these.
The fit is secure and comfortable. Actually probably the most secure I have used at this time.
The sound is good and clear. No rattle or anything. Good balance of sound. I don't hear anything else either.
The button is awesome! I have grown to hate the touch sensor buds. These have one button. Sweat does not interfere with function!! So frustrating to listen to music and lifting, running, ect and suddenly only hearing 5 seconds of a song because sweat activates touch sensors... these ear buds solve that!!! The manual is very clear. My attention span is low right now and the manual has everything done clear with pictures and words.
Phone calls also work!!! Alot of headphones and ear buds suck. My friends tests them with me and said this is the best so far!!!

These earbuds are truly impressive and I have used quite a few. The design in black is sleek and modern, making them quite the stylish accessory. What's particularly good is their ability to stay securely in place during sports activities or while commuting on a bus or bike – a practical feature for us on-the-go folks.

The sound quality is quite exceptional, thanks in part to the ear tips that effectively block out ambient noise, elevating the overall music experience. The design choice to offer extra support behind the ears results in a slightly larger case, which is easily forgiven once you realize it supports wireless charging. Charging convenience is always a plus, right?

In conclusion, I can confidently recommend these earbuds. If you're a fellow enthusiast of running or active lifestyles, these earbuds could be your perfect companions. They strike a fine balance between style, functionality, and great sound.

These earbuds are great for working out. I weight lift and had trouble with AirPods falling out several times. The over the rad attachment was too expensive to make sense for me to buy after spending so much on the AirPods themselves. These earbuds are great quality for the money and exactly what I needed for the gym.
AirPods are basically the same but for ten times the price. These are much more affordable and practical for my budget. I do not need the most expensive, most popular earbuds when I am going to use them at the gym and get them sweaty and gross. This brand is reliable and makes good value products for the money. I will definitely buy their earbuds in the future. Buying products like this on Amazon is much more affordable than buying products from electronic stores or the mall.

The ear hook buds are great for running or other activities and don't fall out. They sit really nice in the ear and have surprisingly good bass. Particularly for the price.

If I am in a room instead of outside it's better. The battery life has lasted me through workouts and conference calls, so no complaints, and the case has a surprisingly long battery life - several charges of the buds.

I waited a long time to evaluate these headphones. They quickly became my "go to" when I walk and at work. The earbud part is not the most comfortable (probably bc I have not put the correct size padding on) but my favorite part is the ear hoop. They never fall off when exercising, cutting the grass, never, because of the ear hoop. I will even hang them from my ear and leave the bud part outside my ear when listening to podcasts or music. The batteries seem to last a long time. The longest I needed to use them was 4 hours and they lasted the entire time.

When I use them for calls, as I frequently do, nobody complains about the sound, volume, or clarity and that is important!

First it is nice to see when the case is fully charged since it has a little light bar to check on charging. Sync is so easy with laptop, chrome book, Ipod, Ipad and my cell phone. Ear Buds hold a charge extremely well. When you place the ear bud in case for charging it shows you how much you have left and then starts charging. When you place an earbud back into the case it shows you by bars how much was used, then blinks red as the ear bud is charging. They are very comfortable fitting over the ear. The charger is the latest usb C cable so you can use the same cable if you have the latest fire. The case is nice and small that you can throw into a small purse for last minute errand so you can use to listen to music on a run or any thing.

However, if your looking for a good quality set of headphones for a great price then these will meet your needs.

The headphones come nicely packaged and include the earbuds, charging case, charging cable and 3 sizes of eartips.

The setup was very simple. Remove the earbuds from the case. Open the bluetooth settings on your phone, find the A17 headphones in the list, then click on them and pair. I was connected in a few seconds.

The sound quality on these are on par with other low end earbuds. They are great for Phone calls, Audio books and podcasts. When listening to music I found the the bass to be lacking for my preferences. . The sound was a bit tinny. However for listening to podcasts or audio books they were great.

I hate 'virtual' buttons that aren't visible and don't respond consistently. The A17 has a real button on each piece that gives a good, tactile klik. They're comfortable enough to wear to bed-I use a sleep app that feeds different sounds to each side, so lightweight earpieces I can roll over on without pain, or them breaking or falling out is crucial, and these work well for that. The in-box display is something lacking in models I've gotten from other companies-I know how charged up each earpiece is, and how much is left in the charge pod. I do a lot of audiobooks while walking, shopping, and background noise is minimized well. Very happy with these!

I use Android phones (4 of them actually, S22 Ultra, Pixel 4a 5G, Motorola Styus 5G and Revvl 6 Pro 5G) but I use Apple Airpods 3 as my go to earbuds..., why?, because they are the only open earbuds design with good sound, good microphones, lightweight comfortable design that sit best in my ear lobes without having to push anything into my ear canals and feel all that pressure in my head. If you are an Android user that wants an open ear design but don't want to shell out $140 to get good sound, good speakers and mic, lightweight (but not as lightweight as the Airpods 3 I confess) comfortable earbuds, you cannot go wrong with these earbuds.

Instructions were clear and I was able to navigate the button settings, which other products typically don't have. Also comes with an extra pair of earbud pieces.

I love these headphones. They fit in my ear securely. I enjoy that you can turn the headphones on and off by pressing the button on the headphones. I've had quite a few headphones; this is the second pair I've purchased with the same company. The sound quality is decent, and talking on the phone is clear. You can answer, hang up, and adjust the volume on the headphones. The headphone case is slim and comes fully charged upon arrival. The case comes equipped with a cord to charge the headphones with a USB chord. I highly recommend this brand of Bluetooth headphones and this company.

5.0 out of 5 stars Best I've found so far
Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2023

There are many different options out there, one of which is the GNMN pair that looks similar to this, but boy are they different. Not only is the BOLOXIA better at the bass, soundstage, and comfort, it is better designed for user use in my opinion.

At work I use gloves regularly, which makes headphones controls more than a little annoying with all of the earbuds that have the fancy tap feature. Which is why I truly appreciate the step back to the trusty button. It doesn't feel crunchy, it's easy but not too easy to press, and is big enough and in a good enough position to easily find and use with gloves.

Another thing I would like to add is how truly comfortable these are compared to the GNMN pair, which were already comfy. The GNMN pair for me hurt when I pushed them into my ear trying to hit the button, but these don't have that.

I own both sets of wireless headphones. The green pair fits fine, but it has drawbacks that this new Boloxa solves. Old: no charge indication, poor sound quality, and the ear buds are on the opposite sides - meaning the bud on right is placed in the left ear - sounds minor but annoying.

The Boloxa has excellent sound - clearly the most important feature, good bass even. Great functionality of the buttons - both buds have functional buttons. USB-C charging = faster and becoming a standard. The bud on the right, goes in the right ear! Paired with my Samsung S10e easily, and handles calls well.

I am in need of ear buds that go over the ears as I never can find earbuds that stay in my ears. Got these earbuds as I am a fan of Boloxa headphones. I tested these right off the bat while running a 5K. They stayed in my ears perfectly and the sound was incredible. My suggestion to anyone purchasing these is to be sure to read the directions that come with the earbuds (I didn't). Once I looked over the instructions, I was able to see all the things I can do with just a simple touch to the earbuds.

I received my BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones a few days ago and I’ve had the chance to use them in several different situations. Sitting in my office, they are great for work calls - clear sound and easy to control - volume up, volume down, next/previous track, answer, etc. Walking my dog, same story - easy to adjust volumes and mute/unmute. No issues with fit or keeping them in place. This is a particularly good feature when doing anything that involves a little more movement - other buds I have tried tended to move or fall out when I was jogging or working out - these stay in place. No issues with getting them wet from a little sweat either. Charging is super simple in the case and I have found that I get better battery life than I have seen with other buds. So far, I have charged them once and it seems like I will only need to charge about once per week at my normal usage rate. For the price, it would be hard to beat these headphones. I recommend!

I received my new Boloxa Wireless Headphones in pristine condition. It was well packaged so even if there was any damage to the Amazon box, certainly the headphones would be untouched.

Pairing them to my device took less than a minute, no exaggeration. I was astonished with the ease and very pleased because I'm not a tech wizard -- far from it, in fact!

I changed the ear tips to a smaller size, of which there are 3 to choose from. I then turned the music on and was blown away by the clarity, bass, and quality of the audio.

All in all, this is a purchase I don't regret and neither will you. Look no further and place your order. You can thank me later! 😇

They came in neat packaging, the instructions were clear and easy to follow and the sound is so clear and smooth in them!! They’re very light, stay in your ear (which is a huge plus for me because I sweat a lot and get earwax a lot which makes earbuds slide out all the time for me) and they’re very durable and comfortable on the ear since they’re not too small, they’re the perfect size. The bass is also amazing which is also a great thing for me because I can’t get enough of bass in my music, 10/10 overall for me.

I’m a runner who likes listening to podcast while I run. These really work great while running and do not move! I can push them into my ear or leave them just out of my ear to hear traffic better. You can only put one in and either one will play for you. No wires to tangle with my bike helmet as well. Battery life is way better than expected for the size of the ear bud. Has a great carrying case to protect them and keep them clean. I can also wear my glasses with them and it doesn’t bother my ears any. Really excellent product for the cost.

These boloxa a17 earbuds are so comfortable I forgot I was wearing them! There are three different sizes to choose from so they fit perfectly in your ear, and the part that goes over your ear is comfortable too. They connect to your phone right away! I wore these going grocery shopping and they drown out the noises from the store. It is very easy to switch songs on the earbuds. The sound quality it amazing! I had to turn the volume down cuz it was such good sound! I have also wear these working around the house. The distance these have is great too! My phone can be in the house and I can walk down the driveway and still be able to have sound. I leave my phone in one spot while I walk around my house doing things and the earbuds stay in place. Even with the over the ear part, I was able to wear sunglasses and my sunglasses stayed on and my ears never hurt! The earbuds turn off and charge when you put them back in the case. They turn on and connect to your phone when you take them out of the case .

So what’s great about these?
1. Fit perfect in the ear, especially when running or working out.
2. Price is great since I usually lose my headphones at least one a month.
3. The deep base and the noise is really rich.
4. Along with standard soft tip ear piece, the two extra pieces included are perfect for smaller ears, like my kids
5. Lastly, the battery has been better than expected. Most of my older headphones would last only a 2 hours, but these are lasting on the higher end of 6 hours continuously.

The A17 Bluetooth Headphones Stereo Sound by Boloxa has really given me a better option in headphones. Low profile while in the ear and the charging cradle is straight forward, connect it to a USB port and forget about it. I have a variety of Bluetooth headphones, from over the ear to in the ear to sports and these A17 do bring these styles into one. I enjoy switching from each style depending on the environment I'm in (office/home) and now that these A17 have a combined style I can stick to using 1 longer, especially with the long battery life. One of the major features I like about these is that each unit comes with a control button which means I can pause the music from either my left ear or the right ear and continue with the other unit. Also switching to next or previous songs while playing music is as simple as touching the correct unit. The price is right at the market value as well, I can't wait to see what they (Boloxa) have coming in the future.

These earbuds are great. They work perfectly and with no problems what so ever. The earbuds' battery lasts for a long time, which is perfect for long trips in the car or on a plane (I had multiple flights so these things were lifesavers). They are also great for exercise because the hooks make it so that it doesn't fall out of your ear. I run everyday on gravel/dirt and the previous ear buds I've had fell out of my ears multiple times, causing it to get dirty and make me stop in the middle of my run just to clean them. It came to the point where I just held the earbuds in my ear while i ran. It became really irritating and I decided to try something different, hoping for better eaebuds, and Im glad I did. recommend this to anyone who is active or just want to have clear, working ear buds.

I was skeptical about the quality a pair of $30 headphones can deliver, but these headphones are very good. Sound is very crisp and the Bluetooth lag is almost non-existent. When the earpieces were fully charged, I used them for almost an hour and the battery went down only about 3-5%. I personally like the fact that they have ear hooks (I know, it's subjective), so they don't fly out at the most inconvenient moment and I don't need to get them deep down into my ears.

The one thing that makes or breaks the earbuds I purchase is how well it will fit on my ear, and these probably have the best grip out of any of my previous purchases. It feels rather strange at first, since the noise cancellation does a really good job at making outside noises near silent, but it ends up fitting comfortably around my ear, it causes no issues and it is very much flexible so there is no risk of them falling off and getting damaged. I highly recommend them!

I received this set from the seller. I have had wireless earbuds before. However, they are ones without the ear clip/hook. With my old buds, I am always worried about losing them or falling off when in gym or walking or public transit. So, I was very interested when I saw these. They do fit well and no fear of falling off. In addition, the little case it comes with is type C which is great. But, for me the mindblowing thing is the wireless charging. Just put the case over my phone charger and boom it charges. I have heard Apple buds have this but having such convenience at cheap price was great. It also shows the current battery percentage in the case, not just lights to indicate battery level. I will be honest; sound quality is nothing to rave about, but it is adequately loud and clear. All I need for them to be functional during my commute, exercises etc. which it does well. I wish it connected to two devices simultaneously, but it doesn't. So, you have to disconnect one to connect to another. You can use only one ear if you wish (like cycling). If you are purchasing, be on lookout for good offers and coupons instead of full price.

5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones for the price
Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2023

I chose these headphones because I was looking for a pair of comfortable wireless headphones that could fold up- and within a certain price point because I didn't have a lot to spend on a pair.
I have tried these with both my desktop computer and my iphone. The bluetooth paired easily with both and I didn't have any issues with the headphones while using. I tried out the volume and EQ buttons and all seemed to work fine so far. The sound was good and I have no complaints about that.
The only thing that I could find that may be a downer for some people is that these are not very noise cancelling. It doesn't bother me because I'm not really in a situation where that was a priority, but I can tell you that they don't offer much more noise cancelling than any typical set of on ear headphones. I wore them while using a craft cutting machine and while using an electric mower (makes noise but not as much as a gas powered) and both times could def still hear all the noise- muffled of course but I did need to increase the volume of the headphones to play over it. Like I said though for me not a dealbreaker since I was going more for price, sound and size over noise cancellation.
Overall I am happy with my purchase- no regrets

I purchased these on prime day. I have ear buds and like to listen to music while mowing, the earbuds worked but let too much outside noise in, volume had to be at max and even then wasn't loud enough. With the new headphones, I have the volume about halfway and can here fine. I recently flew across the country and used them the whole way, they worked great. Battery life so far has been good. While on the plane, passenger had a pair of Bose he had just purchased for $300.00. They may be great but not for me, I will stick with these and keep the $250.00.

These work well, with no issues concerning the mic or sound - both are great. I like how compact they can be, having the ear cuffs pivot inward and folding into themselves. That definitely helps, since I use them for work and work from home and in the office. My dog has learned not to bother me when they’re on, too! LOL It’s taking me some time to remember to press a button on the side of the headphones to answer calls rather than pressing the phone call accept button on my phone, however, that’s probably a me thing. I am glad I came upon them as an option!

I was looking for a pair of wireless headphones that I could wear while gaming but would also last quite a while on battery. For the price point, these headphones do not disappoint. I'm very happy with the comfort and how light they are. I've only ran the battery down to where it tells me "battery low" once and it took a couple weeks to do so. They don't compare to a high end headphone, but if you just need something wireless and sounds good, these are a decent bank for your buck.

Will they block outside noise completely? No but they do a great job of muffling outside noises to the point it doesn't distract you from what you're listening to.
They will get sweaty if you choose to workout in them but for that purpose, they're comfortable and lightweight.
The latest Skullcandy headphones they are not BUT that's not what you're paying for anyway.
At $17, these are worth their money and you get solid quality without the price tag.

[EDIT: By default it will connect to the last paired device when you turn it on. To UNpair the headphones without accessing the last paired device, press both the forward (AKA '+') and backward (AKA '-') buttons at the same time. You will hear the message "disconnected" and the light will blink blue and red. In the instructions they describe this as "resetting" the headphones in the "Other Function" part at the end.]

The sound quality is wonderful and I love the equalizer feature. They feel very comfortable - the padding also reduces the amount of sound that nearby folks can hear. Unlike some rechargeable Bluetooth devices that also support calls, the remaining battery percentage appears on the phone's Bluetooth screen (which prevents unnecessary charging). I haven't tested the battery life, but if it's anywhere near what the seller says (70 hours) then these are a great buy. Don't forget that they're foldable for easier storage when traveling.

However I do find myself taking them off when I need to use the buttons. I seem to end up accidentally powering it off sometimes. That could just be me: it might be time to put my fat thumbs on a diet.

They do not push up against my glasses on my ears when I adjust them correctly. They also fold up, so they are more compact in my gym bag.

 These headphones have good style. They are lightweight but feel like they could be durable. I use many different headphones and the most common place for most to break is usually the headband. This headband feels pretty flexible. Feels like a flat metal bendable strip inside the cushioned headband. They do feel comfortable. They hug my ears a tad bit but my head is larger than average and they are lightweight so it isn't that bad. They fold and the earmuffs can be turned inward instead of outward. Probably should have been the other way so when you take them off your head and put them around your around your neck the earmuffs will lay on your chest instead of the hard exterior plastic. Haven't completely tested battery life but they advertise 70 hours and a 2 hour charge time. In my opinion, if it only does 2/3s of that it's still 2 days playtime on one charge and that's amazing! And last but not least is sound. At this price point it's great. I've paid double the price on plenty of other headphones that don't put out more sound. It also has 3 EQ SETTINGS! Vocal, pop, & bass. If you are a person that prefers to not spend much on your headphones or if you want some to gift kids these would be great! They look good, feel durable, have good sound, long battery life and won't hurt your pocket if you lose them like I've done working at a fast pace then sitting mine down and forgetting on many occasions.

Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2023
Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
TL:DR at the top - For $20 you are NOT going to find a better wireless headphone. Battery life is exceptional, it has three built in EQ modes which I personally *love*, battery life is incredible, and, if you do actually need to use them wired, they actually sound great as regular wired headphones, too!

They do not, as far as I can tell, have a microphone, and the driver is >40mm but you have to make sacrifices to get the cost down. The noise isolation, even without ANC, is incredible. If you have unusually massive ears the ear cups might be closer to "on ear" than "over ear" but for I'd say, 90% of people they should fit right over your ears just fine.

Full review:
If you've seen my past headphone reviews, you know already that I will not hesitate to verbally tear into a product that doesn't live up to its price point, especially when it can't even do the thing it's supposed to do (i.e. not sound like two tin cans strung together)

Conversely if something performs beyond my expectations, especially at its price point, then you'd better believe I'm going to sing its praises to anyone who'll listen.

Some important information up front: these are CLOSED BACK headphones with a thick ear cup. This means that you are going to get sound isolation passively, but this also means they aren't going to sound the same as an open back headphone. The sound is going to literally sound more "closed off" without the EQ presets (or your own EQ on your device of choice).

That effectively means that listening in wired mode will sound different from smaller on ear headphones or open back headphones. That's just the trade off for passive noise isolation.

There is no active noise cancelling feature, and no microphones. You can't expect that at this price point, anyway honestly. I have a pair of BT earbuds in this price range that have passthrough, and the audio is so bad on those microphones that I just take them out entirely if I need to hear something ;)

Battery life is, as far as I can tell, as advertised, meaning I haven't had to charge them yet, and I've had these for about two weeks now.

They fold easily, which can be a good or a bad thing depending on your point of view. The folding hinges could be a point of failure, but I once had a pair of $300 audiophile headphones that quite literally fell apart within 3 months due to the same failure point, so ore expensive is not better in this department.

I'd rather have a set of $20 headphones fall apart than $300 ones *any* day.

Final thoughts: I know these are probably just white label Chinese headphones (meaning a white label factory manufactures them, and someone else slaps their branding on to sell them), but if this factory started making Actige Noise Cancelling headphones of this quality, I wouldn't look for a review sample on Vine. I'd spend my actual real world money on them. The value for money here is just that good.

The standout feature of these headphones is undoubtedly their astounding 70 hours of playtime on a single charge. This unrivaled battery life has transformed the way I enjoy music and podcasts, as I can go days or even weeks without having to worry about recharging. This feature is particularly advantageous for travelers, workdays, and long journeys, making these headphones an ultimate companion for extended entertainment.

The audio quality delivered by these headphones is nothing short of phenomenal. The deep bass, crisp mids, and clear highs create a captivating soundscape that elevates every listening experience. The inclusion of three EQ modes further enhances the versatility of the headphones, allowing you to tailor the audio profile to match your preferences, whether you're enjoying immersive music, taking calls, or diving into work-related tasks.

The over-ear design of these headphones envelops the ears in plush comfort, providing an exceptional listening experience even during prolonged use. The foldable and lightweight construction adds to their portability, making them easy to pack for travel or store in between uses. The design strikes a perfect balance between modern aesthetics and ergonomic comfort.

The wireless Bluetooth connectivity of these headphones ensures freedom of movement without compromising on audio quality. The pairing process is straightforward, and I've experienced consistent and reliable connections with various devices. The integrated microphone is a valuable addition, allowing seamless transition from music playback to hands-free calls.

These headphones are designed to cater to a wide range of needs such as working, traveling, exercising, or simply relaxing at home, they adapt effortlessly to different scenarios. The foldable design, coupled with the included travel pouch, adds to their portability, making them an ideal choice for those constantly on the go.

5.0 out of 5 stars Bluetooth Earphones
Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2023
Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
I’ve been staying away from bluetooth earphones because they didn’t last long. Supposedly, the battery on this one is supposed to last at least 70 hours. Ok, so I decided to try it when 2 of my plugin earphones broke within about a month of each other.

First, it arrived already charged so you can use it, although I wasn’t sure how long the charge was, so I charged it a little longer.

Easy to set up with any bluetooth electronics. It’s nice and portable, not like the bigger ones I’ve seen around. Folds up for compact travel and lightweight. The charger is USB-C.

It does come with an audio line just in case, which is ideal and I like that you have that option.

As for sound, it sounds like any other earphone I have had, but I did hear the bass sounds a little more prominent in the music I was listening to.

All of the controls are on the right side of the earphones. Inside the phones is an “L” or “R” to let you know which side is which. It does take a moment to figure out how all of the buttons work, as some of them have more than one function. For example, the volume buttons are also the forward buttons, depending how long you hold them down.

The equalizer is very elementary sounding. The vocal mode just sounded like more treble. Pop mode sounded more blended and I really couldn’t tell the difference in the bass mode. Maybe someone with a better musical ear can explain if there are differences.

It doesn’t matter to me. I just wanted a pair of earphones so I can go around my place and not worry about a line, but also not worry about the bluetooth dying quickly. It is pretty comfortable to wear, but I was concerned that it is smaller than my other ones. The size wasn’t a problem for me.

I didn’t realize it, but according to the description, there is a microphone attached so you can use the earphones for your phone. I haven’t tried it yet because I really don’t see myself using it, but I’m glad it’s there just in case.

The range is pretty good. I passed through a building 35 feet long, and forgot to take the phones off. I could still hear whatever I was listening to, without any interruptions, which was pretty cool.

They pretty much thought of everything.

I think for the price, it’s pretty good. Nothing fancy, just enjoyment.

These WILLMOOD Bluetooth over the ear headphones are a well designed, well made product.
They paired quickly with my computer with Windows 10 Pro operating system. They also paired quickly with my wireless phone, Android system.

The next important feature that I checked was the sound quality. How will your favorite music sound?
They have a very smooth response range, and they have mode button that will allow you to make subtle changes jin the response curve in accordance with your personal liking,. They have a full sound with full bassl, and if you should desire more base simply hit the mode button for a boost.
I listened to a few of my favorites. Some Berlioz, 'Willy', and Bon Jovi.
From that test I am well satisfied that these headphones could put sound in my ears all day without causing listening fatigue, or discomfort from wearing them for long hours at a time.

They are as the details say, lightweight and comfortable. They conform to your ears.
The fold away feature is really nice for travel or storage.
Again, well designed and very simple functionality.

These are described as headphones and that is their primary purpose but if you need to take a call or instigate a call they do have a microphone function. Not great sounding, not suitable for a podcast but plenty good for phone calls. That is an added bonus to the versatility of this wireless set.
advertised or described as a headset then of course the quality of voice reproduction then it would be fair game for a slight negative rating, but as it is, this is a plus, a bonus feature.

I could not find any location within my apartment where there was a music dropout. Not even when I put my head and headphones were far into the refrigerator with the door acting as a metal shield between myself and my computer. Great Bluetooth coverage.

This is an excellent performer both for sound and battery life.
I have had them playing for over thirty five hours and have noticed no change in quality of sound or coverage. I don't doubt that seventy hours from a full charge is a realistic claim.

I am listening to a performance of "Harold In Italy" where the Pilgrims March has just begun.

In my opinion this is a super value for those wanting to be untethered from a computer desk, and to experience the freedom of wirless music listenihng and commlunications.

Modest price, major performance, equals a very fine value.
True to their description.

I am rating these WILLMOOD Bluetooth headphones five big stars. I cannot feature for the low price anyone experiencing disappointment with this item.

Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2023
Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
My office TENDS to be quiet but sometimes there are outside noises that would be nice to avoid contending with. That and comfort are why I like using 'over the ear' headphones. They cup the entire ear and block the outside noises from entering into my hearing.

I do have the 'expensive' ones (b*se) but I like to reserve those for travel. These do a very good job for everyday use of blocking noises.

First, lightweight and actual relatively minimally sized. When I first looked at the box, I was surprised that the headphones could fit inside. Opening the box, not only were the headphones inside but a USB-USB C charging cord (remember - it's cordless) and even an 1/8" to 1/8" audio connection cable for the times you can't pair to a device. Add to that a multi-page instruction manual and you have the full contents of the box.

Pairing to a desktop/laptop is simple - enter into the bluetooth configuration screen and select the device name. The headphones will report that they are 'paired'. Make sure that the audio in/out is routed thru the headphones and you are ready to use them.

Playtime is reported at over 70 hours. I tend to recharge nightly or every other night so I doubt I will 'verify' this claim. Based on the size/weight of these, I would be happy as long as they last thru a full day of meetings without interruption.

Sound quality with these is very acceptable. It might not be up to the standard set by the B*se ones but it is better than some 'tinny' headsets I have encountered in the past.

One other big plus for me is that the ear cups appear to be removable/replaceable. I have had others where this was not possible and so when the ear cups/pillows were to a point where replacement would be considered, all I could consider was total replacement.

There are other headphones out there that will cost you more and MIGHT provide 'better' sound. For my ears, these headphones will get me through the day with one less wire to contend with. 5 stars.

These headphones are great. They hold a charge for a long time and easy to adjust to any size, especially for people with a lot of hair (me). What I like the most is the three different music modes at a touch of a button. I listen to a lot of audiobooks and these music modes enhance my audiobook experience. Definitely worth the purchase.

I wanted a pair of muff style headphones for when I mow the grass. I wanted muff style well because I'm a man and I like muff plus I wanted to block out the noise of the mower without having to turn the music up high enough to drown out the mower, causing hearing damage. These work great and sound awesome! These are not extremely loud but sound quality is great! Not high n screechy, not drowned out in bass, but an excellent balance. The lows are audible but won't rattle your head. The battery lasts for many hours. Put these on your list of headphones to have!

Delivered a couple of hours before a Zoom class. They must have been charge because they fully charged in less than an hour.

Quick paired with my HP laptop. Comfortable and lightweight to wear. Non slip which is important since I’m playing ukulele for class. I checked with others (after class) and they were able to hear me and my uke clearly.

Nice features: I’m able to adjust wound quality (my previous pair had huge base that wouldn’t adjust and basically distorted tile overall sound). I love that these fold for portability and that they can fun wirelessnor wired.

Hoping the battery lasts as listed. If it does then these a re definitely a good value.

I ordered these dual-ear Bluetooth headphones for my husband who uses them with his laptop for videos and music. He has a super-large head which is often a problem when wearing headphones. He was delighted that these headphones fit his head (at the largest setting). The headphones come with comfortable ear pads and are lightweight. The sound quality is excellent (both treble and bass); I was impressed, especially given the reasonable price point.

The Bluetooth works well. He connected the headphones to his laptop. To test its range, he walked away from his laptop wearing the headphones. The Bluetooth disconnected around 40 feet from the laptop. It charged fast. My husband also tested the headphones in "wired" mode, with the provided cord plugged into the laptop. He said he didn't have to turn on the headphones and it worked perfectly. I love that these headphones can be used with Bluetooth or in wired mode. I can tell he's very pleased with them! I hope this is helpful information.

Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2023
Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
Well, the first thing that struck me about these when I opened the box, was that these are definitely right there in the $20 range. It's nice that they come with a charging cable and an Aux in cord. I was thinking about this the other day with other headphones, and wondered if the cord was actually long enough to do anything productive. It can look deceiving all wound up. So, I stretched this one out, and it is a very decent length. Should be plenty long enough to plug into those airline seat monitors and still be able to sit back some.
Now, for the current price point of $25, these are really good. They are lightweight, so some plastic, but they also have some metal in them. So, they should last longer than those all plastic styles out there. The controls are easy to find and feel, so that makes it a lot easier to figure what you're doing. It boasts 3 eq settings, and there are differences between them, but I wouldn't call them significant. So, that leaves sound overall. I feel these have a very decent output and surprisingly really sound good. There is enough bass, but not so overpowering you miss on the treble. The mid-range is crisp. It's nice they tell you in big letters which is which side. The earmuffs are comfortable, but a tad on the small side. That's my only complaint.
For the price, these are really good and well worth consideration.

The wireless headphones work easily via Bluetooth (pairing was standard) and with the included cord (for situations where Bluetooth pairing isn’t possible or preferred).
- The charging cord is included. The headset operated for several hours after being fully charged & still had plenty of power.
- The sound quality was solid for this size and price level. We really like the noise minimizing benefits for focus.
- Comfort—these are lightweight and felt good. The ear covers are replaceable, as well.
- The headset also folds up easily. I would recommend a carry bag or case to protect them in a backpack or bag.
Bottomline: Great over-ear headphones for the price point.

Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
I got these headphones for one primary purpose and that was to use them with my TV. They were easy to pair via bluetooth and had them up and working in a very short time after charging them up.

For my use, I really liked them. The sound was good, I wore them for an 8-hour stretch and my ears weren't bothered at all. I used them while watching TV and with my Xbox through my TV.

There's a little bit of a delay using them to play Xbox through the TV connection, but that isn't unusual given that I wasn't using them directly with the Xbox itself. I believe the only way to do that with these would be to use the included cord to connect it to the audio jack in the controller. There was no delay while watching TV and the audio was in sync.

I also like how these fold inward to be more compact for storage. Given the price point, I did not have an unreasonable expectation of them being a high end headphone set, but for how I use them, the sound is good, they are comfortable on my head, and I'm quite happy with these.

I wanted an extra pair of over the ear headphones and I saw these at low price with bluetooth. The bluetooth connected easily to my ipad. I listened to an audiobook for 45 minutes while cleaning the kitchen with the headphones using bluetooth. They are comfortable and lighter than our other over ear headphones. These come with a usb-C charging cable and a 3.5mm jack cable. I never use the phone mic but I might try the EQ switch. These headphones are not noise cancelling but over the ear headphones muffle the outside world pretty good for me. My Daughter wants us to test the 70 hour play time on a full charge. These worked right out of the box but I did charge them later. I can use these with my old devices that do not have bluetooth with the included 3.5mm jack cable. It’s great to listen to music free of wires. These headphones are an incredible value!

Initially out of the package I didn't expect much. My daily over the ear earphones cost almost $400. These don't look or feel as premium. However, they don't cost nearly as much. Once you connect them which took just a few seconds with my S23 Ultra, the sound actually surprises you. Controls are easy. The call button which doubles as the music button has 3 different modes. Sound quality is pretty good.

The only thing I don't like about these is the ear quality. They don't feel comfortable enough to wear for an extended time. They could be a little larger and softer. Aside from that, these are great.

I was honestly surprised by this modestly-priced wireless/wired headphone set. It marks the ears L and R for you to keep track (more important not to mix them up, than most folks realize!) and comes with a cord for wired connection (always the best quality sound) but the wifi, super-easy to pair and then to connect at will, is also giving very high quality sound - but, as I am a classical music listener, I cannot comment on its performance for heavy bass. What impressed me most of all was the sheer physical comfort of wearing them, even for hours at a time as I do while reading. Viewed relative to its price, this may be the best of the many headphones I've been collecting and using for the last several years after we got noisy neighbors!

Not too bad for a budget set of cans! Sound is pretty good. Not audiophile quality for sure. 3 EQ modes let you control how you listen. I was very curious of the super bass mode. I am not a bass heavy listener but I was surprised how the bass mode enhanced my music without muddying out the sound. Fit and comfort are good. The ear cups are on the small side but cover my ears.....if you have larger ears these might seem to fit like on ear headphones. Phone call clarity is excellent.....I could hear the other person clearly and they could hear me very well. Charging was fast out of box via USB-C cable. Also included is a 3.5mm audio cable for wired listening. Build quality seems very good.....the ear cup hinges are metal which surprised me....again. These are a very good set of entry level Bluetooth headphones. I recommend!

I really got 70 hours of play time on a single charge (really didn't expect it to live up to it advertising). The connection was easy and since it has a 3.5mm jack, power isn't really an issue. Since the price is about 20% less than a comparable set I was looking at, I feel pretty good about it. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good quality but not a big price.

Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2023
Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
These are very nice headphones. If you're looking for something affordable with excellent quality, this is a good option.

Some things to note --

- Comfort: While these are standard headphones, they are not obnoxiously big. They fit around adult ears comfortably, and the cushion is nice. The headphones also don't press against the head, but do a better job of hugging it.

- Audio quality: Very clear. We connected these to an iphone 11 and they sounded better than the system we have in two of vehicles. I was very impressed. I'm a semi-professional musician who is married to a professional musician and whose four kids all display a decent amount of musical ability. Sound quality is important to us. These are nice.

- Sound blocking: The headphones are also nice enough to block out exterior sound. (So now our kids claim they can't hear us when they have these on --- just great......) But seriously, you're not going to hear interference from sounds around your environment. That can be a pro or con depending on the situation.

- Price: Very happy. For the price these are listed at, they are a good buy.

- Connectivity: It took less than 2 minutes for my 14-year-old to get them connected. Very easy to handle and connect with our devices.

Enjoy your listening!

So I bought these not really having any idea of what to expect.

When I opened up the box with thr headphones I honestly had 2 things that were a dissapointment. The audio cable is about 3' too short and the USB charging cable is really short too.

The USB cable being short prevents me from setting the headphones on top of my desktop. I have a power backup under my desk so wire length is important.

Other than that they are incredibly comfortable, they don't put pressure on your ears.

The sound quality is, in my opinion, is really good. I use these for gaming* and it is noce to have headphones that the sound quality makes it easier to distinguish where something os coming from.

The fit is fine, and the earmuffs are soft, putting no pressure on my pressure-sensitive ears.

All in all, I am very happy with this purchase.
