272,Excellent product for the price.,"Verified Purchase
Very solid product, for the price. I had to have a product that could control volume and song skipping via the earpieces and with a button, and not those annoying touch sensors. This product does that. The only thing I'm disappointed in is that the case, although narrow in circumference, is a little too tall to comfortably keep in a pocket that has other items in it, as well. Yeah, I just wish it wasn't so tall in build.

17,What's not to Love?,"I recently ordered the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones Stereo Sound for Sports. I was unsure about ordering them because they were different from what I usually use. I have never used ear buds with the loop that wraps around your ears and was a tad leery. These are now my favorite! The ear buds and loop are so comfortable. I almost forget I’m wearing them. The loops are not rigid, but very flexible and sit comfortably on my ears. The buds I normally wear are loop less but more rigid and become uncomfortable after wearing them for a few hours. The Boloxa A17 can be worn for hours without irritation. They do not unexpectedly pop out of my ear during use, either. I’m no longer having to look all over for earbuds that decided to fall out of my ear.
Not only are they comfortable, but the sound is also fantastic! The bass is phenomenal. Sometimes I only use one bud while I’m at work. The sound is still great! The button controls on the buds make it easy to operate the different functions of the buds. If someone walks in and I must have a conversation with someone I just tap the button and it pauses. Phone calls are clear and easy to answer as well.
The charge lasts for a long time. I can get about 8 hours of use out of one charge. If I wear only one bud, I can get double the time. I switch them out when one bud needs charging. The case is also very nice. I don’t have to plug the case in to charge every day. Normally, I can get 3 days out of one charge.
I plan to order another pair of the of the Boloxa A17 so I have a pair at work and a pair for home. I’m highly satisfied with this purchase. I have not found a better set of earbuds at this price point.",tammi,2023-08-01,5,,False,False,0,True,i’m highly satisfied|forget i’m wearing|tad leery|sit comfortably|boloxa a17|unexpectedly pop|phone calls|price point|buds make|button controls|long time|charge lasts|Bluetooth Headphones Stereo|Headphones Stereo Sound|recently ordered|ordered the BOLOXA|Sound for Sports|ear buds|loop,0,"What's not to Love?.

I wanted to watch tv after my wife has gone to bed, in a manner consistent with both allowing her to sleep and me to thus survive the experience. Additionally, I did not want a lengthy cable tethering me to either the television or soundbar. As neither the tv nor my soundbar are capable of bluetooth connectivity, I pondered this quandary for quite some time, I am sorry to say. Then... epiphany!

Subsequent research revealed this lovely set of headphones is highly rated by thousands of reviewers and furthermore, was obtainable from Amazon without a co-signature from my bank's loan officer, thereby allowing the occasional, continued purchase of red meat.
On the technical side, instructions to connect and disconnect were clear and easily accomplished. The sound quality is very good, with three different acoustical settings. Surprisingly, I found I enjoy the heavy bass setting best. Also, the controls are ergonomically placed to allow for easy manipulation and another plus is the lengthy battery life, which frankly, is quite astonishing!

3,"Comfortable, great sounding headphones that actually stay in my ears","After buying various in-ear headphones for walking/running, I've finally found a pair of headphones that doesn’t fall out of my ears! The over the ear clips are the key to keeping the headphones in place, and yet they are still comfortable to wear. I don’t even feel the clips, and the headphones are easy to put in and take out. I’m pretty sure my left ear hole is smaller than my right, and with other headphones even using the smaller earpiece in my left ear would still cause that earbud to fall out. But not with these headphones and the over the ear clip.
The sound quality of these headphones is excellent too, especially the bass, which can be difficult to get in this type of headphones. Usually I look to the over the ear headphones for good bass, but for exercising that’s a bit too bulky and leads to unwanted ear sweat. These headphones do a terrific job of reproducing all the highs and lows you'd want to hear.
I experienced no problems pairing the Bluetooth headphones with my Android phone and my Ubuntu Linux computer. The range is as good as any other Bluetooth devices I use – all of course depending on the Bluetooth adapter in your device and any physical obstructions in between.
While I haven’t had the headphones long enough to see how the batteries hold up long term, I can say that they hold a charge for a very long time. The digital display on the case that shows the remaining battery percentage is a nice touch, too, as are the multicolored lights on the earbuds themselves that show the connectivity status. A reasonable length USB charging cable is included, as are the different size earpieces. The button on the side works well for pausing or skipping tracks. I can’t say I’ve wanted to test just how waterproof these are, but they are advertised to be IPX7 waterproof, so I guess we’ll see if I encounter any wet weather in the near future and I’ll report back if I do. The charging case makes these ear buds super portable. I’m unlikely to even need the charging cable to plug them in when going on trips.

The over the ear clips are the key to keeping the headphones in place, and yet they are still comfortable to wear. I don't even feel the clips, and the headphones are easy to put in and take out. I'm pretty sure my left ear hole is smaller than my right, and with other headphones even using the smaller earpiece in my left ear would still cause that earbud to fall out.

195,Great Earbuds with a Budget Price,"Verified Purchase
These are my first set of wireless earbuds and I have to say that I am overall satisfied with the product. For $30, it gives a great bang for the buck. It does not have the best quality sound in the world, but it still provides an immersive experience good enough for listening to your favorite music or listening to podcasts. The earbuds pair instantly with your smartphone as long as your phone’s Bluetooth is turned on. The pairing process is very simple and I have not run into any issues. The earbuds themselves are very light and there are different sized buds that come with the packaging so you can find the ones that best fit your ear. The charging case is nice and light, and has a magnetic mechanism that allows for easy charging for your earbuds.
There are a few cons but they are very miniscule in comparison to the pros. Adjusting the volume though the earbuds can be a little annoying at times due to the 1-2 second lag time that is present upon attempting to adjust the volume through the control buttons. Additionally, the control buttons themselves can be a bit hard to press down. Lastly, for the charging case itself, there is no “on” or “off” button, so the case is constantly charging when you put in the earbuds, even when you don’t want it to.

Pairing was instantaneous. Wearing it is very comfortable. Better than any earbuds I have had, cheaper or much more expensive. The fit is snug enough that I do not believe it has any likelihood of falling off. As I have just had them, I cannot comment on how long the batteries are going to last one charge. There is no statement in the manual as to how long it is expected to last. The bass is significant for something this size.
They aren't noise canceling. However, they basically cut off all external sound. Dont planning on carrying out a conversation why you are wearing these and listeing to something..
Very pleased.
UPDATE
In these days of COVID I had to record a presentation for a conference talk, that will be broadcast virtually. The microphone on my Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Yoga 3rd gen proved to be terrible. After I tried all the accessible mikes, I found these head phones, in the phone mode, lying on either side of the laptop produced by far the best results. I was overjoyed. I recommended it to my work, they bought a couple of pairs and two colleagues bought them as well and are very happy. Unfortunately I have no idea where I put the pair after that recording session, I never could find it again. So I cursed but almost immediately, on August 18, ordered another pair.
All was good in heaven but not quite 6weeks or so later, as I picked the pair out of the charger, one was rather hot and the light wont come on and it wont work. After some more trying I contacted ""Beben Gift"" through their facebook page - they asked me to send a video demonstrating it wasnt charging and I did.

131,Decent headphones for this price range.,"Verified Purchase
These headphones are worth the money. But I may be getting something for writing this review.
1. Pairing.
Pairing is easy the first time and from there the headphones take care of the rest. When I pull them out of the case they will automatically turn on and pair with the phone. I'll hear ""power on"" from each headphone and then ""primary"" from the right and ""secondary"" from the left followed by ""pairing successful"" from both.
2. Charging.
Charging is easy with the indicator light but it uses micro-usb which is less than ideal in the current USB-C environment. The headphones are magnetized and have a satisfying snap when you put them into the case. While one is labeled Left and the other is labeled Right, either headphone will fit in either slot. The headphones last an entire day (6ish hours) comfortably without the case. Speaking of the case, it's way too bulky for a pocket (because if the thickness) but will fit easily in a bag.
3. Sounds quality.
Bass is above average for this class of headphones (under$50). Highs are clear but mids are harsh. ""Hotel California"" (acoustic version) sounds nearly as good as my galaxy buds but ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is a struggle with the electric guitar sounding screechy. The theme from Jurassic Park sounds good too.
4. Sound cancellation.
These headphones cancel no sound. Some buds will have some passive sound cancelling from the tips in the ears but these have no such feature. Regardless of headphone tip, you will hear loud sounds over your music which may be good if you're taking these running. Medium to low sounds may be blocked out by your music but not by the headphones themselves
5. Fit
These are really comfortable and come with 6 pairs of tips in various sizes. They are light and you won't feel then even after hours on your ears. They feel snug and don't fall out when after vigorous exercise - jumping and running.

While the earbuds were secure, the over-the-ear piece was comfortable and didn't make my ear sore over time, as I have experienced with similar earbuds. The audio quality is impressive, especially for the price, and I haven't had any problems with audio leaking out of the earbuds when on higher volume.

When I opened up the amazon box I wasn't expecting much for the $33 price tag I paid for these earbuds. I checked the box to see what came with it and the cable was a USB C cable but the charging port is a Micro USB. I have plenty of Micro USB chargers so this wasn't an issue. I synced these buds to my Microsoft Surface Pro for a meeting and there were a few comments on how well they were able to hear me versus when using the Microsoft built in microphone. Now with COVID I was needing a flexible headset and I can use them all day with no problems. On the third day I was having some issues, I contacted support and they responded very quick and they showed me how to reset the earbuds. I paired them with an older LG G4 and i don't think they were 100% compatible with them and it caused issues when I was connected to my iPhone and Surface Pro. Also they act a little wonky when the battery is almost dead but that took a few days to happen.

41,Highly impressed and would buy again!,"I have a pair of Bose QC35s and love them, but definitely not gym headphones and wanted something small but would not fall out of my ear when I am on equipment. I tried the type you insert into the ear but those never really fit well and would always fall out. So started my search for a different type of bluetooth headphones to use at the gym and around town. Had a list of requirements: 1. Needed to be compact and the fit on my ear, 2. The sound quality and battery life. Stumbled on these and was very curious as this hit a majority of the requirements from what I can tell so decided to give them a try.
Was very impressed on the quality and battery life when I received them. Definitely not Bose but I really do not mind using these at the gym, around town or even when doing yard work. They have a loop that make them stay put on my ear and come with different size ear pieces to make sure they fit snug in your ear. They never fell off while running on the treadmill which was a big concern with the Apple style ones for me.
Besides the initial charge for 100% when I received them I have not had to charge them up. Been using them at the gym for about a week for 6-8 hours and outside while doing yard work (I did initially charge them to 100% before using). They are light and at times forget I am wearing them.

UPDATE: These are decent for the price. The buttons and audio menu system are ok, it's not a great experience adjusting volume. The lag is pretty bad on video and the connection range isn't fantastic compared to other bluetooth speakers/headphones I've owned. That said, for the price they are a great entry into true wireless earbuds.
I haven't had these for very long, and will update if anything changes. They arrived fully charged and I have been using them for some time now. Sound quality is good, nice bass. Charging case is smaller than I expected, wouldn't want to carry it in my pocket all day, would do fine in a small bag, maybe back pocket. They are comfortable enough, with several ear bud sizes.
The buttons are a little annoying to push while in your ear, if you push directly you end up mashing it down your ear canal, so you kinda need to push up into your head and risk dislodging the earbud or use your whole hand to stabilize it. Minor quip, but affects usability some.

I ran with them earlier and they worked well. One issue I've had with other wireless bluetooth earbuds is that they would get out of sync and one side would stop working.

The sound is great, I can't hear outside noises very well while listening, which is great. A lot of headphones that are on the cheaper side don't have sound quality like these do. I also tested the range of the headphones to see if I could go into other rooms and still be connected to the device. I've had other devices where I could go a certain distance and be okay, but one step too far and it's disconnected. These headphones haven't had that issue, I can walk all around my house and the sound is crystal clear. I'm excited for these headphones, and to see how they will hold up. So far the battery life is excellent and have not needed to charge them after multiple long uses. I love that they have a case to store them in and that I can charge them in so they don't get dirty and they are handy to grab and throw into my purse. Bonus for these is no chord, so they can not get tangled or get lost within my purse because of the case. It is super helpful. Tonight I used the headphones to watch a show while doing dishes. With headphones in the past I would have to pause my show while I rinsed the dishes because I couldn't hear what was going on. The water completely drowned out the sound of the headphones.

201,Great Sound Quality,"Verified Purchase
I have wanted a pair of wireless earbuds for quite some time, but could not justify spending more than $150 for them. I saw an ad on Facebook for this model and thought I would give them a try.
I am blown away by their sound quality!!
I played a range of music including Classical, Jazz, and Viking Metal to get an idea of the sound range/quality and was very impressed. The high-end vocals/piano were crisp and clear. The Bass response was solid, and the mid-range came through with solid results.
Other Pros:
* Lightweight - I can keep them in my ears all day and barely notice them
* Battery Life - I can wear them all morning, then charge them during lunch, then wear them for the rest of the shift.
* Noise Cancellation - my wife came into the office and was calling my name. I didn't hear her until she tapped me on the shoulder.
* Size Attachments - there are multiple end caps to provide the proper fit for you.
* Ease of Pairing - it took less than 30 seconds to pair with my Mac and my iPhone, and they connect straight away when I take them out of the charging case.

5,Great sound and so easy to setup,"Set up was a breeze. The package comes with clear instructions, and many will be able to do this without reading the booklet. I read everything to make sure that I did everything correctly. Out of the box one bud was 98 percent charged and the other was less. In about one hour of charging with a adapter (not included) both reached 100 percent. . The indicator is wonderful to let you know the percentage and you can even tell when the case is done charging and the earbuds are still charging. Once the red blinking stops you know that the case and buds are both 100 percent. 3 sets or sizes of 'bud ends' are available. The one out of the box is fine with me but nice to be able to replace down the road or have options of size. Paring was amazingly easy. I have an Android Samsung Galaxy phone. With buds out of case, I went to Bluetooth and scanned and selected A17 and it was ready. Easy!!! Next, it was time for what I call the real test. The sound quality is rich and full, and the buds are great at noise cancellation. Very impressed. Make sure they are placed properly in the ear in order to experience the rich and full sound. Easy to control on/off or volume control or skipping tracks are all available with a simple touch on the right or left. Can also answer a call and hangup a call using a few simple touches to the earbud. All clearly explained in document included.
Standard to other earbuds. In summary, I am very happy to find these stylish earbuds on Amazon at a fraction of the price of the big brand name. Hope to get some good use from this product.

226,Better than other higher prices wireless buds,"Verified Purchase
I was sick of tangled cords at work from my wired earbuds so I decided to go wireless. Unfortunately it seems like some manufacturers think they're shipping you a product made out of gold. I wasn't willing to pay hundreds for a halfway decent pair.
I've been using these for a couple weeks now. They come with adjustable rubber pieces so I was able to find ones that fit my ears well. I can't speak to the battery life over an extended period but I can tell you they haven't run out across 4-5 hours of use a day at work. Since the initial pairing, they've automatically paired with my phone each day without issue.
The sound quality is excellent for the price. I'm sure there might be better sound on super expensive ones, but I didn't need all that at work anyway. Sometimes I want both buds in, sometimes only one. When I take one out and put it back in the case, it automatically unpairs and puts the sound to only the one remaining bud. When you take the second bud out, it automatically resets to stereo.
I'll update this in 6-12 months to add comments on longevity.

I'd been on the hunt for a decently-priced, over-ear, bluetooth headphone for well over a year (at least) before I tried these.

Then there was another pair from some other brand that fit, but had trouble actually connecting to my laptop via bluetooth. I finally bought this pair, and so far, so good. I've had them for a few months and have used them for several hours pretty much everyday, and they are fantastic for the price.

125,Surprisingly well rounded in-earbuds for price.,"Verified Purchase
I was really skeptical of the sound quality of these and you never know what you are going to get with some of these less popular branded headphones. I've been waiting for Googles pixel bud 2 to come out, but they are taking forever and I really can't justify the $180 price tag.
With Amazon's return policy, I thought might as well give these a try and my old pairs battery life is deteriorating.
They are delivered and I see that there isn't any winglets for my unusually shaped ears. Most brands fall out of my ears with slight movement. I put them in and I'm worried it would fall out... I start shaking my head like a wet dog and they stayed put. This is great as I'll use these 90% of the time in the gym.
They paired up really simply with my Google Pixel 3 XL phone in seconds and the sound was exceptionally well. If you are looking for a little bit more of a bass heavy headphone, this is it. At max volume, listening to Disclosures Tondo song, they don't distort and the bass is hitting like in my car... Making me want to dance!
I'm using Google play so the EQ is on which puts more bass as my old pair needed it always on.
As for functionality, I was able to figure out the skip buttons quickly (two taps). One tap pauses. I needed to figure out the volume, which is okay, you have to hold down the buttons on either side and it slllooowwwly lowers or increases the volume. I think this will be okay since I can control volume on my phone and watch.
What was a surprise is that Google Assistant worked with three taps on either ear! So if needed, I can control basically anything now with voice.... Though it's still awkward to do so.
I'm not sure how call quality is, but as with many, I don't actually use my headphones to usually talk on as it's just habit to use the actual phone or my cars stereo system.
Wish this had usb-c charging port instead of micro-usb but I'll survive. Happy to not be with dead headphones in the future as I tend to forget to charge all the time.

143,Excellent Call Quality,"Verified Purchase
I decided on these Beben x8 for my first pair of wireless earbuds after reading numerous reviews and comments about call quality and price for different brands of earbuds in all price ranges.
Straight from the case, these earbuds easily paired to my Samsung Galaxy s9, and automatically connect whenever I remove one or both earbuds from the charging case. The Beben x8 wireless earbuds looked a little big when I first removed them from the case, but after turning/adjusting/fitting each earbud with the proper-fitting ear cover (I took the time and tried each set), each earbud cradles comfortably in my ear and stays in place even during hour-long phone calls and does not move around when I talk. I found that if the earbud does not have a good seal in your ear and feels too loose, music will sound tinny. With the right-fitting ear covers, these earbuds can block out tv noise in the same room, and music is rich and full. They sound great!
The voice assistant is easily activated with three taps on the earbud, and the call is ended with one tap. Both earbuds have mics so I can use either one for phone calls. I prefer to use one earbud when I’m on a phone call so that I can hear myself speak and not talk too loudly. The person on the other end states I sound clear and cannot tell that I am using an earbud.
I’ve had these Beben x8 wireless earbuds for 3 weeks now and I am very satisfied with this purchase—no wires hanging from my phone or getting tangled up, they look great, they’re comfortable, they’re easy to pair and use, excellent call quality, clarity of sound, good battery life, and a great price.

385,compact - easy adjustments - rechargable - replaceable ear cups - acceptable sound,"My office TENDS to be quiet but sometimes there are outside noises that would be nice to avoid contending with. That and comfort are why I like using 'over the ear' headphones. They cup the entire ear and block the outside noises from entering into my hearing.
I do have the 'expensive' ones (b*se) but I like to reserve those for travel. These do a very good job for everyday use of blocking noises.
First, lightweight and actual relatively minimally sized. When I first looked at the box, I was surprised that the headphones could fit inside. Opening the box, not only were the headphones inside but a USB-USB C charging cord (remember - it's cordless) and even an 1/8"" to 1/8"" audio connection cable for the times you can't pair to a device. Add to that a multi-page instruction manual and you have the full contents of the box.
Pairing to a desktop/laptop is simple - enter into the bluetooth configuration screen and select the device name. The headphones will report that they are 'paired'. Make sure that the audio in/out is routed thru the headphones and you are ready to use them.
Playtime is reported at over 70 hours. I tend to recharge nightly or every other night so I doubt I will 'verify' this claim. Based on the size/weight of these, I would be happy as long as they last thru a full day of meetings without interruption.
Sound quality with these is very acceptable. It might not be up to the standard set by the B*se ones but it is better than some 'tinny' headsets I have encountered in the past.
One other big plus for me is that the ear cups appear to be removable/replaceable. I have had others where this was not possible and so when the ear cups/pillows were to a point where replacement would be considered, all I could consider was total replacement.

A slight update. After continuing to use these earbuds I can say they work better than I expected. Perhaps the technology has improved. The sound has continued to be great as well as the connectivity. So far they are better than the other earbuds I've had.
I've had many of this type of wireless earplugs. I'm almost always disappointed by very key features - sound quality, wireless connectivity, ease of use. Usually I give them away to friends or my kids...and then they sit in a desk or kitchen drawer for a while. :)
So I think this is the first pair of wireless earbuds that I will keep. They are very easy to pair to my phone. The phone detected them right away. The earbuds notified me they were pairing. That was it. I switched to streaming music on my phone and the sound quality was quite good.
The earbuds were already around 90% charged (that showed up on my phone too) so I could use them for a while right out of the box. The case charges them as well as protects them. The case has an indicator to show how much charge is left within its battery.
As I said, the sound quality was quite good. I used the streaming apps feature for tuning the sound to my ears...it plays tones to identify which frequencies I pick up easily and which I don't. With these earbuds I had a perfect 'hearing test'...I could hear the entire frequency range of tones the tuner played.
The earbuds fit well within my ears. They feel comfortable and actually are kind of easy to forget about. I was walking around listening to music and then my kids started talking to me...I had to pop out an earbud to talk with them.

Verified Purchase A slight update. After continuing to use these earbuds I can say they work better than I expected. Perhaps the technology has improved. The sound has continued to be great as well as the connectivity. So far they are better than the other earbuds I've had. I've had many of this type of wireless earplugs. I'm almost always disappointed by very key features - sound quality, wireless connectivity, ease of use. Usually I give them away to friends or my kids...and then they sit in a desk or kitchen drawer for a while. :) So I think this is the first pair of wireless earbuds that I will keep. They are very easy to pair to my phone. The phone detected them right away. The earbuds notified me they were pairing. That was it. I switched to streaming music on my phone and the sound quality was quite good. The earbuds were already around 90% charged (that showed up on my phone too) so I could use them for a while right out of the box. The case charges them as well as protects them. The case has an indicator to show how much charge is left within its battery. As I said, the sound quality was quite good. I used the streaming apps feature for tuning the sound to my ears...it plays tones to identify which frequencies I pick up easily and which I don't. With these earbuds I had a perfect 'hearing test'...I could hear the entire frequency range of tones the tuner played. The earbuds fit well within my ears. They feel comfortable and actually are kind of easy to forget about. I was walking around listening to music and then my kids started talking to me...I had to pop out an earbud to talk with them. I haven't had any dropped connection with the earbuds and my phone. With past purchases of wireless earbuds, it was odd that some movement of my head or being a short distance away from my phone caused the connection to drop. So for now, these feel like a win.

165,Excellent Headphones! Excellent Value!,"Verified Purchase
I consider myself an audiophile; I love immersive music of all kinds - jazz, classical, EDM, hip-hop, R & B, rock... and, yes, even a little bit of county. I love hearing the sound of fingers sliding across strings, of a breath being taken before the passing of a bow on the violin, the grunts and groans of an instrumentalist in the groove. THESE HEADPHONES PUT ME THERE! They ABSOLUTELY deliver on sound quality and sound isolation. The lows are low; The highs are high and crisp.
I was highly impressed from the moment I received them in the mail. From the outer packaging, to the top-to-bottom foam insulated box, one thing you'll notice about these headphones is the great attention to detail. Even the rubber caps are 'high-quality' in build, yet very appealing to the eye. They feel durable - not like other rubber caps that feel like they're made from cheap plastics. The units as a whole fit very snugly, yet comfortably in my ears. I put the 'waterproof' claim to the test and took a shower with them, while listening to one of my favorite jazz tunes - flawless. I was expecting some type of distortion or interference from the water, but amazingly, these phones are designed in such a way that the water channels through without disrupting the vibes.
I tried some vigorous workouts with them as well. Again, the design keeps the phones in place, so much so that you almost forget they're in your ear... unless someone tries to talk to you or get your attention.
After having used these headphones, I would gladly pay even more than they are priced - they're that good. They're easily worth $40 ($20 a bud). But at 30 bucks ($15 a bud), you can't go wrong - worth every penny.
I'll be retiring my previous MIFA bluetooth headphones to the 'back up bench' (which I paid the same price for, I might add).

191,Nice earbuds,"Verified Purchase
What I like:
•I’m not deaf to the world around me when wearing these.
•After pairing with a device, they connect reliably and automatically. Every time. No daily fussing in your device settings needed.
•I’ve frequently worn them in the shower.(don’t ask..) I’m still careful not to drench them for a long period of time but I think you could.
•They stay in pretty well.
•The price.
I have small ear canals and have always had difficulty finding earbuds that will stay in. These work for me.
I honestly have no idea how the sound quality is compared to other earbuds. They sound just fine to me. I use them for listening to podcasts and the occasional video game.
Battery life is reasonable. 5-6 hours? More or less. This storage/charging case is tiny, which I like a lot.
It doesn’t have charging output (to plug a cord into and charge your phone with from the earbud case) like some brands do.

106,Great price and quality!,"I have been using these for about a week now. The sound quality is better than the other ear buds I have tried in this price range.
Overall physical construction quality of the ear buds and case/charger are good. Flush buttons on the ear buds blend in seamlessly. The ear buds fit into the case easily, even with the ear hooks and sync up to charge every time. The ear hooks on the buds are flexible and comfortable. They also really help to keep them in place when working out and moving around. This allows you to not need to push them into your ear canals as tightly, but still stay in place. That makes them more comfortable for me, especially when working out.
The bluetooth syncing was quick and the signal is strong. I can go to the other side of my house and leave my phone in the other room and the connection stays strong. Latency is low.
The case charges the ear buds quickly, and I like the indicators for the individual ear buds charging as well as the charge level of the battery in the case - handy! The battery in the case also charges quickly - even via USB plugged into a laptop. Battery life of both the ear buds themselves and the case are also good. I was able to charge the ear buds several times (didn't count) before needing to charge the case again.
Sound quality is good both for podcasts and music with good bass level for ear buds - better than other ear buds I have used.

118,Great set of wireless earbuds for a very affordable price.,"Verified Purchase
As someone who buys phones largely based on whether they still have a headphone jack (an increasingly uncommon feature), it takes a lot for me to be willing to pick up a pair of wireless earbuds—especially given how insanely expensive most of them are. I've owned Xiaomi AirDots and Redmi AirDots (Xiaomi's are comparably priced; Redmi's are around $25). By comparison, the Beben Earbuds are noticeably better. My review will make some comparisons.
Pros:
–Sound quality is solid. It gets pretty loud if you need it to be, and it sounds great whether listening to audiobooks or to music.
–Waterproof!! They advertise it as being good for taking showers, which I can't do with the Xiaomi or Redmi AirDots. I've tested it out and it's a great feature. The case itself is also said to be waterproof, but I haven't tested that myself. But it's nice to know it's there.
–Great battery life. Because it has Bluetooth 5, it also shows the battery life of the earbuds in your Bluetooth settings. It's rated for 5 hours of playback, but I think that literally means ""playback,"" not just being powered on, because I had them in my ears for over five hours (had them playing continually for about 2) and they were still at 70% when I put them back in the case. So battery life seems quite solid. (By comparison, the Redmi Airdots seem to fizzle out at around 4 hours.)
–It comes with a year warranty which is pretty incredible and a great guarantee for the waterproof rating.
–The multi-colored lights on the earbuds themselves are a nice touch.
–There are a lot of very small but noticeable details that show the quality of the Beben earbuds. The charging case has some haptic feedback when you plug it in to confirm you're charging. The earbuds come with alternate sized tips, and with a little loop string you can attach to the case and put around your wrist. There are 4 indicator lights on the case that show how full its battery is. And the magnetic closing feature is a nice touch.
–Dual use or single bud use works effortlessly. On the Redmi/Xiaomi AirDots, you have to use the right bud as the primary and the left one only works if you have the right one on. With these, you can use either one on its own without any additional need to mess with Bluetooth settings. It's super convenient.
Cons:
–The case itself is a little bulky. It's 2.25 inches in diameter and 1.25 inches thick, so depending on how big your pockets are, it might be a tight squeeze.

A few years ago my husband bought me a pair of noise cancelling headphones. They were great for noise cancelling, but the wires constantly got in the way, and the foam ear pads never fit my ears quite right. When the ear pads finally wore out, I took it as a sign to get some wireless ear buds. I couldn't spend a lot of money on them (thanks, pandemic!) but wanted to make sure I got something I felt would actually stay in my ears, provide at least decent sound quality, and had a good battery life. So, I bought these, along with two other wireless ear buds, and did a side by side comparison. While there were positives to the other two I tried (one had a case that could also be used as a charging block for other electronics, and the other was a style more reminiscent of Apple Airpods but in black), the number one thing for me was the way they fit in my ears (I have tiny ears). I have to say, the Beben X8 ear buds fit AMAZING. They have three different sizes of ear caps offered in two different materials so you can personalize the fit to your ears. They fit great out of the box, but I ended up changing to the slightly smaller size cap for a little more comfort. Because they fit so snugly, their noise cancellation is incredible! I was listening to music on a low volume and didn't hear my husband trying to ask me a question--he didn't love that, but I sure did! I also wore them while doing a workout and didn't feel like they were going to fall out once! They're incredibly light weight, and the case, in addition to charging the buds, also has a magnetic closure, so I feel secure that it's not going to open up in my purse. So far the battery life has been great. I charged to 100% (four lights) a few days ago and after using for a few conference calls and to listen to music, it's at 75% (three lights). The pairing process was super easy, though my only complaint is that they will only pair to one device at a time (i.e. I can't have them paired to my iPhone and my Mac at the same time, I have to disconnect from one then re-pair to the other).

177,Great Bluetooth Headphones!,"Verified Purchase
I wasn't too sure what to expect when I ordered the product ( unfamiliar with the brand and not very expensive); however, I am pleasantly surprised with the headphones.
I've always believed the little things 'set the mood' - the item was well wrapped and the didn't seem cheap thrown together. The rechargeable case seems pretty sturdy/well made, and the earbuds are on the smaller/lighter side for those who don't want the large,bulky earpieces.
Sound quality is pretty respectable - I've tried all kinds of headphone brands and price ranges, and I can say this is a top contender. I listen to a variety of bass-heavy music, and I feel that my expectations have been exceeded. They dont have that cheap/squeaky tune and the sound is very LOUD and FULL. I usually have the volume on max with any other set, but i dont go much past 50% - 60% with these. Noise isolation is pretty significant even at lower volumes. In the office or around the town, I wasn't able to hear anyone or anything else - love it!
The included manual mentions they are water proof and you could swim/ not completely submerge them. Bluetooth pairing was super easy any they work solo/together ( didnt use instructions bc didnt need to) - the voice prompts will tell you when they're paired to the phone, pair to each other, and even which one is primary/secondary. there are additional neat little features built in that the manual will explain.

When I went to look for bluetooth earbuds for my wife and myself, I was going for the name brands (Samsung, etc..) but was reading good and bad reviews. Plus, with the pandemic hit, my pocketbook was a little strapped, so I decided to look at other lower priced models. I came across the Beben bluetooth earbuds here on Amazon and loved the great reviews. I then watched a few unboxing vids about them. It seems that no one really had anything bad to really say about them. So, we ordered two sets. They arrive on time and in great shape. Straight out of the box, they had enough charge to turn on, pair, and play music for me for four hours. The case had about half charge on it so I let it go for five days without charging it, until the battery was depleted. I charged them overnight and by morning I was listening to music, talking on calls, and just enjoying these comfortable earbuds.
The noise cancellation is AMAZING! I have taken to wearing one when I am out and about as I am completely immersed in my own world when they are in and lose track of everything around me because I cannot hear it. The sound quality is amazing! I am not a soundphile, but I do have an ear for music, tuning, and bad tones: these earbuds deliver great close to true sound. Calls on the earbuds are clear as can be! If my wife uses hers while she is at work, I can hear her coworkers whispering from the next room over. She can hear me perfectly. Even my aged parents can hear me when I use them and call them. Overall battery life for me seems to last a good 7 hours. I charge the base maybe once every week and a half.

9,Durable and Intuitive Earbuds - Great for Exercising!,"I received the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones quickly after ordering. They arrived in good shape and with a 95 percent charge. The box included the buds, charging case, charging cable, additional covers, and directions for use and maintenance. The buds paired very easily to both my phone and laptop and have extremely intuitive controls. Since they initial pairing, they always connect easily upon being powered on. They charge quickly and hold their charge for use throughout the day. The case is chunky enough that it is durable and not easily misplaced, but can also easily fit in your pocket. The buds slide very easily in the case for a quick and convenient charge. I wear them to run in Houston, where the temperature exceeds 100 degrees regularly and they have done well despite being regularly drenched in sweat (I do recommend drying and cleaning before charging)! The buds have really nice flexible ear wraparounds, so they stay in very well and are suitable for vigorous exercise. I wear them for almost 8 hours straight each day and find them to be very comfortable throughout. Other buds often leave my ears feeling sore after wearing, but that has not been the case with the Boloxa A17. The volume on these buds reaches an appropriately loud level, where I have found other similar products to not be loud enough to hear when exercising vigorously or vacuuming. The sound quality is clear and crisp, which is unusual at this price point. There are large buttons on both ears that allow you to control volume, change songs forward and backward, pause, answer calls, and use your phone's assistant. The buttons are defined enough that they are easy to find while running and also have enough resistance so that you are not constantly hitting them by accident when adjusting or removing them. A bonus to this product is that, in addition to being able to use both headphones, you can also use each one independently. I appreciate this, as I often only wear one when running in areas that have vehicle traffic or are crowded. I highly recommend these buds - without question the best that I have found anywhere near this price point!

5.0 out of 5 stars A True Sports Companion
Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2023
I recently purchased the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations in every way! As someone who enjoys an active lifestyle, I needed a pair of earphones that could keep up with me during sports activities, particularly running. These earphones have been a game-changer for my workout routine.
One of the standout features of the BOLOXA A17 is the charging case. The quality of the case is excellent, and it provides a secure and convenient way to store and charge the earphones. I love the added feature of being able to see the battery percentage on the case. It allows me to plan my workouts better and ensures that I never run out of juice during extended sessions.
When it comes to the earphones themselves, they are specifically designed for sports enthusiasts like me. The ear hooks are fantastic! They fit snugly and securely around my ears, guaranteeing that the earphones won't fall off no matter how intense my activities get. This level of stability is crucial, and it gives me the confidence to focus solely on my workouts without any distractions.
Connecting the earphones to my phone is a breeze. The Bluetooth pairing is lightning-fast, which means I spend less time fiddling with settings and more time enjoying my favorite tunes. The sound quality is surprisingly good for the price. The audio is clear, and the bass is punchy enough to keep me motivated throughout my entire run.
I also appreciate the durability of these earphones. They have endured a fair share of accidental drops and still work flawlessly. It's evident that BOLOXA has put a lot of thought into the design and construction of these headphones.
In conclusion, the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones are a fantastic choice for sports enthusiasts and fitness fanatics. The charging case with the battery percentage indicator is a thoughtful addition, and the secure ear hooks ensure a worry-free workout experience. The quick and stable Bluetooth connection, along with the impressive sound quality, makes them a steal at this price point.

The box included the buds, charging case, charging cable, additional covers, and directions for use and maintenance. The buds paired very easily to both my phone and laptop and have extremely intuitive controls. Since they initial pairing, they always connect easily upon being powered on. They charge quickly and hold their charge for use throughout the day. The case is chunky enough that it is durable and not easily misplaced, but can also easily fit in your pocket. The buds slide very easily in the case for a quick and convenient charge. I wear them to run in Houston, where the temperature exceeds 100 degrees regularly and they have done well despite being regularly drenched in sweat (I do recommend drying and cleaning before charging)! The buds have really nice flexible ear wraparounds, so they stay in very well and are suitable for vigorous exercise. I wear them for almost 8 hours straight each day and find them to be very comfortable throughout. Other buds often leave my ears feeling sore after wearing, but that has not been the case with the Boloxa A17. The volume on these buds reaches an appropriately loud level, where I have found other similar products to not be loud enough to hear when exercising vigorously or vacuuming. The sound quality is clear and crisp, which is unusual at this price point. There are large buttons on both ears that allow you to control volume, change songs forward and backward, pause, answer calls, and use your phone's assistant. The buttons are defined enough that they are easy to find while running and also have enough resistance so that you are not constantly hitting them by accident when adjusting or removing them. A bonus to this product is that, in addition to being able to use both headphones, you can also use each one independently. I appreciate this, as I often only wear one when running in areas that have vehicle traffic or are crowded. I highly recommend these buds - without question the best that I have found anywhere near this price point! lily 5.0 out of 5 stars A True Sports Companion Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2023 I recently purchased the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations in every way! As someone who enjoys an active lifestyle, I needed a pair of earphones that could keep up with me during sports activities, particularly running. These earphones have been a game-changer for my workout routine. One of the standout features of the BOLOXA A17 is the charging case. The quality of the case is excellent, and it provides a secure and convenient way to store and charge the earphones. I love the added feature of being able to see the battery percentage on the case. It allows me to plan my workouts better and ensures that I never run out of juice during extended sessions. When it comes to the earphones themselves, they are specifically designed for sports enthusiasts like me. The ear hooks are fantastic! They fit snugly and securely around my ears, guaranteeing that the earphones won't fall off no matter how intense my activities get. This level of stability is crucial, and it gives me the confidence to focus solely on my workouts without any distractions. Connecting the earphones to my phone is a breeze. The Bluetooth pairing is lightning-fast, which means I spend less time fiddling with settings and more time enjoying my favorite tunes. The sound quality is surprisingly good for the price. The audio is clear, and the bass is punchy enough to keep me motivated throughout my entire run. I also appreciate the durability of these earphones. They have endured a fair share of accidental drops and still work flawlessly. It's evident that BOLOXA has put a lot of thought into the design and construction of these headphones. In conclusion, the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones are a fantastic choice for sports enthusiasts and fitness fanatics. The charging case with the battery percentage indicator is a thoughtful addition, and the secure ear hooks ensure a worry-free workout experience. The quick and stable Bluetooth connection, along with the impressive sound quality, makes them a steal at this price point. If you're looking for reliable, high-quality Bluetooth headphones that are perfect for sports, I highly recommend giving the BOLOXA A17 a try. They have truly become my go-to sports companion, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase!",train

24,Excellent Sports Headphones,"I'm a fan of wireless headphones. I recently bought a pair of these new Boloxa wireless headphones. These are my second pair that I buy for sporting purposes. I've been using them for a few weeks and they are very effective. They fit easily in the ear, it's easy to wear and control these. the battery lasts a long time. They are excellent for doing any sport, especially jogging, since they remain fixed and do not fall off.
The delivery time was indicated by the supplier, there were no delays.
I tried them for the first time with my Xiaomi cell phone and they connected right away, then I did it with my daily use laptop and they also paired quickly. Very easy when answering calls, raising or lowering the volume, its use is friendly. The music also sounds very good. These headphones have buttons on the sides that facilitate their use when exercising. They are also firm headphones, that is, they fit the ear and do not fall out easily. Regarding the sound, I am not an expert on this subject, but I understand that it is good, it is not heard with interruptions. The charging case is practical since it has a screen that indicates the percentage of battery charge that the headphones have. The best thing about these headphones is that they are type c cable and fast when charging. In addition, the battery is long lasting. Also the case is fast charging.
Part of the accessories is that it comes with a small usb cable for charging and some pairs of ear pads.

180,"Comfortable, Affordable Headphones For Use at the Gym, Running, or in Meetings","Verified Purchase
Initially, I was slightly skeptical about purchasing these headphones as I did not think (from what I saw online) that they would be able to meet my expectations, but after using them for the past several weeks, I can honestly say that I was wrong. To begin, the design of the case and headphones is nice...it is small, compact, and sleek in design. The wireless buds fit comfortably inside of my ear, and they do not fall out when I am moving quickly or vigorously (e.g. when exercising). They were easy to pair with my iPhone & MacBook, but a few times, they would not disconnect when I put the buds back into the charging case. The sound quality is crisp and on point. I have used the headphones while hosting and participating in various virtual meetings, and there was no lag in sound and everything audio was highly clear.
One of the few things that I wished this set of earbuds had was a digital display of the percentage of the case. It would be nice to see an early one when I need to recharge the case as opposed to waiting for headphones to tell me when they are about to nonfunctional due to low battery. Also, I was not particularly fond of the plastic buckle in the back of the case. I understand that it increases the flexibility of the case and allows one to open the case further, but I do not think that portion is necessary, and honestly, it makes the design of the case slightly less appealing.

416,"Very clear audio, comfortable around the head, does a good job blocking out sound","These are very nice headphones. If you're looking for something affordable with excellent quality, this is a good option.
Some things to note --
- Comfort: While these are standard headphones, they are not obnoxiously big. They fit around adult ears comfortably, and the cushion is nice. The headphones also don't press against the head, but do a better job of hugging it.
- Audio quality: Very clear. We connected these to an iphone 11 and they sounded better than the system we have in two of vehicles. I was very impressed. I'm a semi-professional musician who is married to a professional musician and whose four kids all display a decent amount of musical ability. Sound quality is important to us. These are nice.
- Sound blocking: The headphones are also nice enough to block out exterior sound. (So now our kids claim they can't hear us when they have these on --- just great......) But seriously, you're not going to hear interference from sounds around your environment. That can be a pro or con depending on the situation.
- Price: Very happy. For the price these are listed at, they are a good buy.
- Connectivity: It took less than 2 minutes for my 14-year-old to get them connected. Very easy to handle and connect with our devices.

We connected these to an iphone 11 and they sounded better than the system we have in two of vehicles. I was very impressed. I'm a semi-professional musician who is married to a professional musician and whose four kids all display a decent amount of musical ability. Sound quality is important to us. These are nice. - Sound blocking: The headphones are also nice enough to block out exterior sound. (So now our kids claim they can't hear us when they have these on --- just great......) But seriously, you're not going to hear interference from sounds around your environment. That can be a pro or con depending on the situation. - Price: Very happy. For the price these are listed at, they are a good buy. - Connectivity: It took less than 2 minutes for my 14-year-old to get them connected. Very easy to handle and connect with our devices. Enjoy your listening!",train

OK after a few months... I love these things. The haptic feedback of the physical button is superior to the ""did I hit the right spot"" aspect of others touch pads. Everything else works as advertised.
The case is well designed with a subtle non slip texture, magnetic lid and magnetic charge ports. The fit anywhere charge ports are especially appreciated if you have ever used a keyed holder where the left bud must go in the left charge port. The case fits well in a backpack, but not a pants pocket.
The buds pair easily and eagerly. The one button per bud control is nice for answering the phone and starting and stopping content as it works the same on either side. Volume up/down is a different story as one is left earbud and the other is right and there is really no easy way to tell the difference between the 2 buds.
The main problem is that the sound cuts out a good bit. If my phone is in my jacket pocket I'm mostly fine. If in my pants pocket and I'm walking I'm guaranteed to have the sound cut in and out.
Keep in mind that its easy to lose one of these things as well, I was outside and one fell out onto leaves and it took 1/2 hour and a bluetooth signal app to find it.

IF YOU READ NOTHING ELSE: don’t forget to remove the plastic strip covering the charging port on each earbud. I'm guessing they need it for shipping but it has to be removed, otherwise the earbuds won’t charge.
The first thing you’ll notice when you unbox these earbuds is the smart packaging. The case has a loop for connecting a carrying strap. It’s a small thing, but it shows the care that went into designing the overall product.
Next was the wide variety of ear tips. The earbuds come with the medium tip pre-installed, but there are also large and small with the black/red design, plus three smaller sizes also included. Once you find the right size, the earbuds fit very nicely and feel great.
Of course the proof of the pudding, in this case, is the listening. How long do the batteries hold up? On my first test, the left earbud lasted 5 hours 21 minutes, the right earbud lasted 5 hours 42 minutes. On my second test, both earbuds lasted for more than six hours. That’s a lot of music! All the while, the sound quality was excellent. And because the earbuds fit so well, there was no outside noise competing with the music.
Finally it was time for a microphone test. I made a call and my testing partner was able to hear me loud and clear.
Another really smart design feature is that the two earbuds are the same shape. If you want to double your battery life, you can use one earbud at a time, and it’s nice if you can choose either one to place in your left ear or your right ear, and not feel “wrong” (like putting your right show on your left foot) - of course this means that when you’re using both earbuds, you might want to know which is which. There is an L or R inscribed on each earbud between the charging port and the ear tip.

I currently own three pairs of bluetooth earbuds. One pair is great overall but not very comfortable. The other pair is much more comfortable but has some annoying quirks like having to pair twice for using one earbud vs two and causing my phone's volume to shoot to 100% every time they connect.
So far, this pair has passed all of my tests:
1) Sound quality is great. Plenty of bass without muddying the mid-range and crisp clear highs. They honestly sound really great (especially for their price).
2) These connect to my phone quickly and allow me to switch between stereo and mono with minimal interruption. Stereo to mono is instant. Mono to stereo causes a brief pause while the earbuds inform me of which is primary and which is secondary but this is okay. No weird volume jumps on connection and you only have to pair once to use the buds in all variations of L, R, and L+R.
3) No noticeable audio lag. One of my pairs of earbuds has about a 300 ms lag, which makes watching any kind of video rather annoying since audio is out of sync with the video. With these, a/v sync is spot on.
4) Well designed case with a magnetic lid and strong magnets to hold the earbuds against the charge pins. With these, I don't feel like I have to worry about them shifting off of the pins and randomly connecting to my phone, or killing themselves in the case. They're pulled firmly into position and I don't have to wiggle them around to get the pins to connect. I plan to purchase an extra wireless charger to test the case's wireless charging ability, which is a very thoughtful addition by the designer, since this technology is very cheap to implement but adds functionality and convenience.
5) The most important test of all: comfort. These are sized nicely. They fit well in my ears without having to force them into place, yet they don't feel like they will fall out. They're very light and don't put pressure any parts of my ear. I haven't used them for an extended period yet, so I can't speak for their comfort over more than an hour or so, but they already feel better than my other earbuds.
All in all, I've found my new favorite pair out of my three. One of my pairs was a gift, so I intend to hang onto them but I may pass my other pair to someone else since I don't think they'll be seeing much use moving forward.

27,Lots of Value at a Low Price,"I recently purchased the Boloxa A17 wireless headphones, and I must say, they left me thoroughly impressed. These headphones are nothing short of phenomenal, offering a fantastic audio experience coupled with impressive features that are hard to believe at such an affordable price point.
One of the standout features of the Boloxa A17 is its wide and balanced frequency response. Whether you're a fan of bass-heavy beats or prefer the crisp clarity of high notes, these headphones deliver an exceptional audio performance across the entire sound spectrum. The sound quality is rich, immersive, and highly satisfying, making it an absolute joy to listen to music, podcasts, or any other audio content.
Battery life is another area where the Boloxa A17 truly shines. With an incredibly long-lasting battery that can easily survive more than a week's worth of visits to the gym without needing a recharge, these headphones are perfect for individuals with an active lifestyle. You no longer have to worry about running out of battery midway through your workout or daily routine. The convenience of such extended battery life is truly commendable.
One common frustration with wireless headphones is the fear of them falling out and getting lost. However, the Boloxa A17 comes with an ingenious design that addresses this concern. These headphones are anchored securely to your ears, ensuring a snug fit and eliminating the risk of them slipping off during exercise or vigorous activities. This feature alone sets them apart from many other wireless headphones on the market.
The inclusion of a charging case with a battery life indicator and charging status further enhances the overall user experience. This handy addition allows you to keep track of the remaining battery life of both the headphones and the case itself, ensuring that you never run out of power unexpectedly. It's a small but thoughtful detail that adds convenience and peace of mind.
One aspect that left me astounded was the affordability of the Boloxa A17. Given the exceptional audio quality, long-lasting battery life, and secure fit, it's hard to fathom how they manage to manufacture such an outstanding product at such a reasonable price point. It's a testament to the brand's commitment to providing value to its customers without compromising on quality.
In conclusion, the Boloxa A17 wireless headphones are a remarkable choice for anyone seeking a phenomenal audio experience, extended battery life, secure fit, and convenience. The wide and balanced frequency response ensures an enjoyable listening experience across all genres of music, while the long-lasting battery eliminates the hassle of frequent recharging. The fact that these impressive features come at an affordable price makes them an absolute steal. I highly recommend the Boloxa A17 wireless headphones to anyone in search of a fantastic audio companion without breaking the bank.

134,My second purchase. Great value for the price.,"Verified Purchase
I like these ear buds enough I may order a second set. A little more volume from them would be nice, but I'm not complaining.
9/1/21: I ordered a 2nd pair. The microphone didn't survive the laundry with my 1st set, but the earbuds still work great and they weren't considered waterproof.
Overall, I like these earbuds for music, podcasts, YT, movies, calls, etc. They stay my ears well while using for to hear my GPS riding a motorcycle without a helmet. (I know...my point is they stayed in)
The first pair I owned I had to be quiet when on the phone or people would say the noise is very loud with almost anything I did; even shuffling papers. So far the newer set are reportedly better. I prefer the voice from the original set over these, and I can't seem to get the to turn off without returning them to the charger.
Sound: If you get the right ear cushions on you will get a snug fit, solid bass, good high and mid range sound. Too small of cushions and they will sound like dollar store headphones.
Quality: They don't feel super durable, but they're light, which is important and I've sent them flying through the air plenty of times and they hold up. Again my 1st pair sort of survived the laundry and they were considered waterproof.
Functionality: I rarely remember what each button does and sometimes drop calls or advance playlist songs or YT videos. With my first set I could easily turn them off without placing them in the charger. The second pair don't seem to function the same. Also, if you don't turn them off and they're not in your ears you may wonder why your phone has no sound; human error? I don't know. Sometimes the headphones will turn off by themselves if not used for a certain period of time. I haven't noticed enough to be able to identify that duration and I have not read the manual for the second set I purchased. So there's that.

I use one earbud at a time (I do need to be somewhat aware of surroundings) and they last me nearly the week. I average probably 6 hours per day at work using them. They can be a little tinny with the sound depending on the type of music being played but really impressed with the bass tones. My only dislike really is the warning for the low battery....it's super short, probably a minute or two before they just shut down. I generally have them on inside a sterile environment so I can't just switch them out.

63,excellent headphones,"Today I want to share my excitement about my recent purchase: a new pair of headphones! Unpacking them was quite an experience. Opening the box, I found a stylish case that protected the headphones from any damage. Pulling them out, I noticed their modern and sophisticated design, with a glossy black finish and metallic details that added a touch of style.
Construction-wise, the headphones felt solid and well-made. The cord was sturdy and seemed durable. Also, I was impressed that they came with different sizes of ear tips to fit my ears comfortably.
When plugged into my device, the sound quality was amazing. The bass was deep and powerful, while the treble was clear and defined. I was able to hear every detail of my favorite songs like never before.
One standout feature was its noise-canceling capabilities, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the music without the distractions of my surroundings.
In short, my unboxing experience with these headphones was exciting. Their elegant design, solid construction, and exceptional sound quality make them a perfect addition to enjoying my music on the go. I am delighted with my new pair of hearing aids!

These headphones are comfortable, great sound, and compact. I've been using them for 2 weeks and I wish I'd bought them sooner.
I rotate headphones frequently, from the WH-900n that I travel with to the more compact sets <$50 that I use everyday. For my daily sets I look for good microphones for calls and passive sound insulation for when I'm in the shop, mowing the lawn or biking. These fit snugly in and around my ears without falling out meeting all my needs, with a solid sound quality. The charging via wireless induction or USB-C works great, and over the last 2 weeks I've really only had to recharge the case once fully.

This was my first experience with the new wireless earbud trend, and I have to say it definitely impressed. These have great sound for being a fraction of the cost of the more popular devices.
The case they come with is magnetic so they fit flush when not in use and it charged them as well, Because of this I have yet to hear any battery low notifications as all day use either with one in or both has been excellent. Pairing was a snap and was a non issue. The moment you take them out of the case they turn on and place themselves in pairing mode so they only need to be selected in your Bluetooth menu.
After pairing they remember the last device they were connected to without issue. I have tried them out listening to Spotify Stations and also picking some particular tracks on YouTube to test the bass levels and it's been nothing short of impressive especially for the price point. Sharing was easy as well as just handing one over for the other person to listen to.
When using only one it operates just like similar single Bluetooth headsets, when you pick up the other earbud they will both pair to each other with an audible ""Primary"" ""Secondary"" and their ready to go. I've used them both in single mode and had no problems with either being the primary. When you are finished using them and place them back in the case they immediately disconnect and start to charge.
They fit in the ear pretty well as I was worried about them falling out and under normal walking even me running across the street there wasn't a feeling of they may fall out. Sitting perfectly against the curve of your inner ear while channeling sound directly is a nice touch. There isn't a preferred bud for left or right so they can be used on either ear and have the same fit.
I can definitely recommend these to anyone looking to get into the wireless earbud trend. They now have become part of my normal daily electronics as I travel.

All I can say, is you need to get these headphones! The quality of the design, fit, and sound is impressive.
I am always looking for the *perfect* pair of headphones that fit in my ears well, aren’t heavy, and don’t fall out after considerable wear throughout a day. I do a lot of talking throughout the day for work as well as use them for yard work on the weekends. Every pair of headphones I seem to purchase only fits well for a short period of time and ends up falling out after talking for only 30 minutes. Enter the Beben X8 headphones!
The box comes with SIX sets of earbud tips that are sure to conform to your personal ear. This seems to always be my problem, but it’s not an issue with these headphones. In addition, the packaging contains the headphone, the charging/carry case, a (short) MicroUSB cable, and a lanyard attachment for your charging/carrying case. It is a nice compact design for easy transport or storage.
The pairing process is easy, but you first need to PULL OFF THE PLASTIC on the underside of each earbud that protects it from the charging pins in the case. Before you charge the units or use them, make sure to do this so you aren’t frustrated after you realize it “isn’t charging.”
The sound quality is superb. The deep bass and clear audio are great for nearly any music type. Adjusting the volume is a breeze, simply hold down on the left to adjust the volume down and hold down the button on the right bud to increase the volume. Want to go back to the previous song? Just double-tap the right earbud. If you want to forward it to the next song, double-tap the left earbud. Want to access your preferred Assistant?

Honestly, this product surprised me. It did everything that was advertised and it did it well. Here are my comments:
- the product box and earbuds case are both very sleek and efficiently take up little room, allowing for easy transport
- the sound quality, which I found to be crisp and excellent, is better than most earbud brands out there
- the user experience I had when it came to setting up my earbuds and learning its features was very good, and although some things aren't outlined in the instructions (such as how to answer and hang up phone calls), I quickly learned the skills
- although it took some fidgeting to try to find the best fit for my ears, when I did finally find it they fit incredibly
- just as advertised, the earbuds are waterproof (I fully submerged mine in water and the sound quality was still great
- the price was incredible, and although I did get a 20% off coupon (leading me to pay only $31.19), the $39.99 price definitely still seems worth it
- lastly, the buttons that control the earbuds are very
There were only three things that bothered me. First of all, the right earbud lowers the volume whilst the left earbuds raises it. I'm used to it being the other way around, but that's a personal preference. Second, raising/lowering the volume takes up quite a bit of time due to the fact that you have to hold down the button for about three seconds just to raise/lower the volume once. Lastly, the earbuds don't really fit too well, and running can cause them to fall off even on the largest setting. If you don't plan on moving too much with them, then these should work just fine fr you, otherwise I recommend looking for another pair.
Here is my overall rating:
User Experience: 4.5/5
- Although the experience was very smooth, I would change a few things here and there, including adding more instruction to the instruction manual.
Sound Quality: 5/5
- Honestly, the sound is incredible, and if I hadn't been told that I was wearing an earbud (and if I couldn't feel the earbud) then I would definitely think that sound was coming from a professional grade speaker.

Fit: 2/5

First, let me say I’m no audiophile, so I can’t make any judgement call from a technical point of view.
I can tell you however, they provide a clear signal and do a good job of cutting out background noise.

The battery life for continued use is about 6 straight hours. But that cool charging pack case can give them a charge even while it is not plugged in. So I throw them in the case during my lunch break and that way they last me all day.
They fall out of my ears, I’m not sure if I have a strange shape to my ear or if the ear piece is just not very ergonomic, but I went and bought a cheap over the ear hook to try to keep them from falling out while I’m working.
I love all the different rubbers ears piece covers, but have yet to figure out which is best for my ears.
Because the buds slowly slip out of my ears there is NO noise canceling, in fact sometimes the outside noise like weed wacker that I’m using drowns out my music. But the earbuds still seem to keep my ears from ringing after I turn the machine off. So they are helping.

I bought these earbuds for hands- and wire-free phone calls mostly, but also for listening to music while moving. They did not disappoint!

395,Really good sound!,"Well, the first thing that struck me about these when I opened the box, was that these are definitely right there in the $20 range. It's nice that they come with a charging cable and an Aux in cord. I was thinking about this the other day with other headphones, and wondered if the cord was actually long enough to do anything productive. It can look deceiving all wound up. So, I stretched this one out, and it is a very decent length. Should be plenty long enough to plug into those airline seat monitors and still be able to sit back some.
Now, for the current price point of $25, these are really good. They are lightweight, so some plastic, but they also have some metal in them. So, they should last longer than those all plastic styles out there. The controls are easy to find and feel, so that makes it a lot easier to figure what you're doing. It boasts 3 eq settings, and there are differences between them, but I wouldn't call them significant. So, that leaves sound overall. I feel these have a very decent output and surprisingly really sound good. There is enough bass, but not so overpowering you miss on the treble. The mid-range is crisp.

I have literally done my research when trying to buy a good pair of ear buds that fell into a cheap price bracket. These have to be the best. The sound quality is very good, they don't fall out when you go for a run or when you work out. There are many ear bud covers to choose from so it's really hard to find one that won't fit your ear. They are small and they fit nicely in the ear. The only thing that I dislike about these is, whenever I connect them to my computer the audio fades in and out all the time.

Without any regard to music quality, these earphones do provide some noise protection but they are not nearly as protective as specifically designed hearing protection. My noise exposure is more constant background drone and not so much extreme loud. I find they work well as simple noise protection.

I find that they are comfortable and fit me well me. I have seen reviews claiming they are not comfortable. Comfort and fitment are highly subjective. Each person has a different level of comfort. Also each person has slightly different head and ear shape/size. What fits and is comfortable for me, might be different for someone else.
Where these headphones fall short is the active noise cancellation. When turning on the ACN switch it sounds more like a simple high pass filter.

45,Great sport headphos,"Last week I bought the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones, and I am very surprised with my choice. These headphones have met all of my expectations from the company and even exceeded them. In comparison to other headphones and also the price, this would be the best choice if you are looking for a headphone with excellent quality.
The headphones are very comfortable to see. They fit any shape of ears and I can wear them during running and cycling without any problem. The sound quality is unbelievable and it also has noise cancellation which works perfectly.
The battery life is also excellent. Usually for my concentration, I listen to music in my office and I used these headphones for around 7 hours without recharging. This is impressive I asked my friend about the battery life and he told me that after a long time of using these headphones, the battery health is like the first day. They support fast charging.
In summary, I am extremely content with my acquisition of the BOLOXR Wireless Sports Headphones. They deliver on their promises of elegant design, comfort, and enduring battery life. If you're looking for wireless headphones, I strongly suggest giving these a shot.

What an excellent pair of headphones! I’ve had many many pairs of headphones over the years, what can I say, I’m not interested in paying $200 plus for AirPods just to have them fall out of my ears while I’m skiing or biking. Anyways, I’m so impressed with these headphones! They come at a budget price point which was very important to me. If I lose them it’s not really a big deal. Been using them for about a week and they’re checking all the boxes. Connected easily to all of my devices. They wrap around the ear so they’re on and secured even during vigorous movement and exercise. Sound quality is very good as is the noise cancellation. This is a small thing probably more “me” than other users but I LOVE that these headphones have a physical button for pause/skip/siri. I think the physical button is infinitely superior to the touch tech button. I never have to wonder if I touched it enough times or the right way.

I think the physical button is infinitely superior to the touch tech button. I never have to wonder if I touched it enough times or the right way. Long story short, these are excellent and economical wireless headphones. If you have gotten this far in reading my review, just buy them already, you won't regret it!",train
159,excellent headphones,"Today I want to share my excitement about my recent purchase: a new pair of headphones! Unpacking them was quite an experience. Opening the box, I found a stylish case that protected the headphones from any damage. Pulling them out, I noticed their modern and sophisticated design, with a glossy black finish and metallic details that added a touch of style.
Construction-wise, the headphones felt solid and well-made. The cord was sturdy and seemed durable. Also, I was impressed that they came with different sizes of ear tips to fit my ears comfortably.
When plugged into my device, the sound quality was amazing. The bass was deep and powerful, while the treble was clear and defined. I was able to hear every detail of my favorite songs like never before.
One standout feature was its noise-canceling capabilities, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the music without the distractions of my surroundings.
In short, my unboxing experience with these headphones was exciting. Their elegant design, solid construction, and exceptional sound quality make them a perfect addition to enjoying my music on the go.

171,Great budget true wireless Earbuds,"Verified Purchase
I have been looking for a good pair of true wireless earbuds for a few months now, and have tried the most expensive ones available, as well as a lot of budget options. When comparing this to others with the noise isolating earbuds, I was pretty impressed with sound quality. This sounded great when listening to music, books, and even while watching Netflix (some budget options have a lag when watching shows). I would say there wasn't a significant enough difference compared to some more expensive options, but better than some other budget earphones I have tried. Also, the volume was able to go very loud, which combined with the noise isolation, completely blocked out outside noise.
As someone with weird ears, it is always difficult to find some that do not hurt your ears. The first thing you notice is that these are very light, so they are able to stay in very well. I also had them on for an hour and didn't get annoyed with them.
Pairing is pretty easy a quick, as long as you pull out the stickers from the charging pins. A must-have for me is being able to use one earbud at a time if I want, which does allow you to do.
The biggest con for me is the case, as it is a little large and not a USB-C charging port, but I also knew that was the case going in so I was not going to take away a star for this.
Overall, if you are looking for solid true wireless earbuds at a fraction of the premium models, I think this is a solid choice. They are comfortable, block out noise, pair easily, and have good battery life. Again, just be aware the case is a little larger and the charging cord is micro usb rather than a USB-C.",BVillegas,2020-03-06,5,black,False,False,0,True,good battery life|usb-c charging port|good pair|charging pins|charging cord|verified purchase|pretty impressed|sound quality|sounded great|watching netflix|watching shows|difference compared|budget earphones|completely blocked|pretty easy|biggest con|premium models|solid choice|pair easily|micro usb|noise isolation|weird ears|Verified Purchase|budget options|true wireless earbuds|noise isolating earbuds|watching Netflix|case|expensive options,1,"Great budget true wireless Earbuds.

For $38, these are a quality pair of budget wireless earbuds.
The sound isolation and fit is great, as the earbuds come with 6 different pairs of tips to make sure they have a secure fit in your ear. I tested the fit while playing rigorous VR games like Thrill of the Fight and Superhot, and they never fell out.
That being said, these aren't for gamers. The earbuds have a small delay in audio feed, which you won't notice when doing something like watching videos but will probably be frustrating to use in rhythm based games like Geometry Dash, Osu, or Beat Saber.
The main use for these earbuds is clearly intended to be fitness. The edge-less case design, strong magnetic case lid and optional case strap all scream ""attach this to your bag while you're on a jog."" It's easy to keep this attached to a bag as well, as in my testing, I went over a week without having to recharge the case once. Extremely convenient.
The case is small enough to be pocketable, but probably not if you're wearing tight pants as it is a little tall. Again, still great for fitness or outside ventures.
The audio quality isn't the best around, but for the price, it's reasonable. The highs are a bit lacking and crackly at times, but these buds' strength is definitely bass. Low ends are crystal clear.
Finally, one surprising benefit of these earbuds is call quality. In comparison to other wireless earbuds I've tested, these have the best mic quality of all of them and are just as effective if not more effective than your actual phone.
For the average consumer, I'd say these earbuds are your best bet.

224,Not bad for the price!,"Verified Purchase
I came from years of buying Bose Noise Cancellation headsets and wired earbuds. I wanted to go wireless but did not want to pay over $100 for new earbuds as well as loose sound quality. I was very surprise and happy with this purchase.
The earbuds came in a nice premium box and were fully charge right out the box. I was able to us them right away to go jogging. They had a perfect fit and never popped out of my ears while jogging. (That was a big problem with my old wired earbuds). The sound quality was very good. It had a heavier bass than what I was used too, but I liked it. I wished it had a better high to well balance the heavier bass. After 10 min of running and listening to music, I got use to it and it did not bother me.
PROS:
* Comfortable - Came with multi choice of ear cushion sizes.
* Good sound - heavy bass
* Long lasting battery.
* Easy to use charging case- Fits easily in your pocket.
* Talk quality is great. (No one complained about not hearing me clearly)
CONS:
* I wish it had a better equalizer from the highs to bass.
* Wish it had a digital display on the case to show battery percentage.
Overall , this was a good purchase and value for the price. I'm very happy with this purchase.

These stay comfortably and snuggly attached to the ear. No more having them fall out while exercising. The control is great because there are easy to find physical push buttons which means you cannot accidentally touch the wrong spot and have the music stop or change. Quite easy to answer incoming phone calls with these as well. The sound performance is particularly good. If you get them sealed in your ears correctly there is a full range of bass and clear highs. The seal does create a seal which suppresses noise. I used them in the pool for a workout and they worked fine. They do last a long time on a charge. I have never used them long enough for them to need recharging during a full day. They recharge easily in the case which has a clear display, and it has a built-in battery to charge on the go when necessary. I am not sure how many recharges there are in the case before it needs recharging. The case recharges with an included USB-C cable. There is a Flashing LED that shows until charged. My set is black as pictured. The size is palm sized. It is easy to hold on to them and they will easily fit in your pocket or purse. They were quite easy to pair with my phone. They are in pairing mode when taken out of the case the first time. Their construction is very solid, and they should last a long time.

I had bought a pair of JVC bluetooth earbuds at a start of the earbud craze about 1.5 years ago. For the $50 price tag, they were nice enough. Sadly, the fit was poor and I dropped one, causing it to break and leaving me with one ear!
Fast forward to 2020, and I've decided to give Beben a try. What a pleasant surprise! The fit is perfect, and I haven't had any retention issues at all. Even if I did, they give you a couple of different rubber pairings that I'm sure will solve your issue.
The battery life has been great. I only use them for 2-3 hour stretches at a time, and they've lasted as long. Like most bluetooth earbuds, Beben gives you a small carrying case that functions as a portable battery for quick recharges when you put them back in the case. The sound quality is superb, and the aesthetic is sleek. Each earbud has a button on the sides that functions as a power button and a pairing button to your bluetooth enabled device. Pairing is seamless and fast, and the buttons work well with the design.
My only issue is that while walking with my phone, the sound has skipped a little bit. I don't know if this was the battery dying, or if the connection was falling out. But the issue hasn't lasted long. I don't run or exercise with the earbuds, so I don't see this being much of an issue in the future.
All in all, these are a 5 star pair of bluetooth earbuds!

I almost NEVER leave product reviews but honestly I am very pleased with this purchase and wanted to make sure that the seller knows and potential buyers can be aware too! I decided to buy these after a lot of research since I was looking for something of decent quality yet affordable. These earbuds had a lot of really positive reviews (which always makes me a little nervous to be honest because I don't know if they are compensated reviews). I'm really glad I decided to get them and so far they certainly live up to the hype!
The packaging was solid and not too over the top. (It's annoying when manufacturers put their product in huge packaging that requires a ton of work to open up.) This was neatly packaged in a really efficient way. Instructions were simple and straight forward, although if you've ever paired wireless products before you really shouldn't need too much assistance because it's a pretty universal process.
They paired up with my phone very easily and just like everyone else stated in the reviews, I was impressed because they came with a full charge and were pretty much ready to go after removing the plastic protection. I was even more impressed with the sound quality for the price and grateful to have found something that offers smaller ear pieces as I have small ear canals. I called my partner right away to to test out the mic quality and he said he could hear me just fine. (I called from a quiet room and used a regular volume. I'm sure if I'm out and about the mic 'may' pick up some more background noise, but that's okay as I plan on using this mostly for music and gaming.) I'm happy about the fact that you can take one earbud out and it easily switches to just mono speaker.

183,Well Pleased - Now have a second pair,"Verified Purchase
When the product arrived, based upon prior reviews the first thing I tried was to charge the system - USB cable for charging was the wrong size for the charging port. It had a standard USB A connection at one end but the end for the charging port was for a different interface. I used a Kindle charger and it seemed to work ok. Sound seems very good for the price. Have not yet tested all the features but it does sync with bluetooth on iPad and iPhone. Have only had it for two days. Update 5/20 was contacted by seller that manufacturer was notified about incorrect charging cable. after using for a few days I am impressed overall (particularly for the price). Seems to be best when listening to music and participating in Zoom calls. Sound over the phone is less quality but that could be from many sources, not just the earbuds. No problems in pairing with iPhone or iPads. Has multiple ear tips so I recommend trying various tips to see how it best stays in the ears.

Verified Purchase When the product arrived, based upon prior reviews the first thing I tried was to charge the system - USB cable for charging was the wrong size for the charging port. It had a standard USB A connection at one end but the end for the charging port was for a different interface. I used a Kindle charger and it seemed to work ok. Sound seems very good for the price. Have not yet tested all the features but it does sync with bluetooth on iPad and iPhone. Have only had it for two days. Update 5/20 was contacted by seller that manufacturer was notified about incorrect charging cable. after using for a few days I am impressed overall (particularly for the price). Seems to be best when listening to music and participating in Zoom calls. Sound over the phone is less quality but that could be from many sources, not just the earbuds. No problems in pairing with iPhone or iPads. Has multiple ear tips so I recommend trying various tips to see how it best stays in the ears.

235,I guess ear buds might not be for me,"Verified Purchase
I've always used ear buds that can hang around my ears and sometimes have a neck strap, but I thought I'd try these smaller buds that suck into your ears. While they are in they sound good, have good battery life and I like the click buttons rather than the touch sensors to control playback and volume. My problem is they just won't stay in my ears. Fortunately, if the left one falls out it usually goes into my shirt pocket and the other one I've been able to find nearby when it falls out.

15,Very easy to use headphones,"These headphones were very easy to work with. They came out of the box charged (both the headphones and the case). I turned them on and they immediately showed up on my phone as able to be paired to. They paired quickly to my phone. Sound quality seems good and they do a decent job of blocking off outside noise.
The headphones themselves fit well and were comfortable around the ears. It comes with three different ear pieces so you can find the right fit. I haven't worked out with them yet but it certainly seems like they won't go anywhere once you find the right ear piece.
The button press controls work well once you learn how to use them. It consistently paused my music when I wanted and started it back up on command. Volume control response is good. Calls also seem to come in clear.
Bluetooth range was decent but does get cut down quite a bit when there are obstacles between the headphones and the device (just the nature of bluetooth).
Now for what I think they could improve on:
1) They could have more fun color options. The only one that was available when I placed the order was black.
2) The last pair I had from this company had the capability to be paired to 2 different devices at the same time. They would play the audio from whichever device last started audio. For example, I would be listening to and watching my TV using the headphones. At the same time they were paired to my computer. So whenever I received an instant message or email, I would stop getting the audio from the TV and would get the chime from the computer. I found this to be a really handy feature. With these new headphones I can only be connected to one device at a time. So I have to go until my Bluetooth settings on my phone, disconnect the headphones, open up the settings on my computer, and connect the headphones in order to switch between my phone and my computer. So it is a bit more cumbersome.

187,Would recommend! Simple and subtle!,"Verified Purchase
I love the packaging of these headphones, and how it came with a little strap so you can easily carry it around. It also came with like six different tips you an switch out to fit your ear size, which I really appreciated.
The headphones are relatively small and easy to use; if you’re looking for a subtle pair; these are nice.
Pairing with my iPhone was SUPER easy; I didn’t even have to read the directions to have it paired and working!
It also works awesomely with single earbud or with both. I took one off and plugged it in to the charger, and then, as soon as it took it back off and put it on, music played out of both of them. No extra pairing was necessary. This is something I like most about these earphones!
Taking them out of the case and clicking a button connects them, and putting them back into the case disconnects it! Super simple and easy to use!
The volume is literally as low as I can put it and it is so nice and loud, which I appreciate as well.
These are almost soundproof, which can be both amazing and kinda scary if you need to keep an ear out for your surroundings. Switching out the tips to a smaller one from the package can help make it less soundproof.
The audio is clear, but not super crisp, if that makes sense. The bass sounds really nice, so if you’re looking for a pair that plays the bass well, this is a nice choice too!
The buttons are easy to use as well.

159,Boogieing in the shower,"Verified Purchase
I got this precisely for one thing - wearing them in the shower. I wasn't expecting much otherwise. However I'm pleasantly surprised. Context - I have a bunch of budget wired chi-fi iems, over ear planars, the excellent Tin Hifi P1 and a few other premium iems with amps and dacs. So I like great sound but I'm not over analytical.
While these are no audiophile buds, I was impressed by the first listen. Not broken in yet so these are first impressions. There's not much low bass, mid bass is quite boosted, vocals are forward, treble is airy and not sibilant or painful. It's not natural but it all comes together quite well, considering it's price. It doesn't suffer the budget bane of being tinny, shrill or a muddy bass or mid-range. I guess it's the kind of sound I would want when exercising or in the shower, with some punch and clarity. This is something I could listen to comfortably. Classical music seems to sound quite good. Sound wise I would guess that they cost $60 in a blind test, and that's compared to wired iems. But this is my first truly wireless.
In the shower it works well so far, the physical buttons avoid the capacitive touch nonsense that activates randomly with water droplets. Phone was about 15 feet away with a wall in between, no signal drops.
Overall I'm more than pleased with these, if you can get past the somewhat dated design of the buttons, but unavoidable for shower use. The case is nice and compact, I hope the hinge doesn't tear over time. The buds go in with a nice solid pull and you can use either bud independently. I'm not rating them for phone calls or battery life as it wasn't important to me.
BTW, being able to listen to my fav music in the shower privately (without disturbing others) totally rocks. Would totally buy again.",T.

Included with the headphones is a micro USB charging cable and several replaceable rubber ear pieces that are different sizes for different ear sizes, a charging box and instructions.
Now at first when I was using them I was a little confused. I could not figure out how to charge them because when I put them in the case the lights would not come on to indicate charging. However after reading the instructions for charging I found that there was a pice of plastic over both charging ports. Simple fix!
That being said, I love these headphones I've used them for some days now and the battery life seems to be quite great! Which is even better considering that you can charge them on the go in the charging box. Which has a whole separate battery itself. The sound quality is great too! Very deep and quality bass when listening to music. Also something I noclticed, when listening to podcasts and stuff where it's people talkingthe voice quality sounds amazing which was surprising to me. Also, I use these headphones to workout and not once did they fall out even on more intense bouts of exercise. The fit is perfect for my ears. That being said I think these headphones are great and that's why I give it five stars.
The only complaint that I have, which is me nitpicking, is that the volume buttons are not to my preference. I have another pair of wireless earbuds similar to these and I double click on the left earphone to decrease the volume and double click the right to increase the volume. Now with these headphones you have to hold the respectice buttons while media is playing to turn up and down the volume. Again just a slight nitpick but for me I wish it was a double click to turn down volume. But overall again a great product especially for the price.

18,Great price and quality!,"I have been using these for about a week now. The sound quality is better than the other ear buds I have tried in this price range.
Overall physical construction quality of the ear buds and case/charger are good. Flush buttons on the ear buds blend in seamlessly. The ear buds fit into the case easily, even with the ear hooks and sync up to charge every time. The ear hooks on the buds are flexible and comfortable. They also really help to keep them in place when working out and moving around. This allows you to not need to push them into your ear canals as tightly, but still stay in place. That makes them more comfortable for me, especially when working out.
The bluetooth syncing was quick and the signal is strong. I can go to the other side of my house and leave my phone in the other room and the connection stays strong. Latency is low.
The case charges the ear buds quickly, and I like the indicators for the individual ear buds charging as well as the charge level of the battery in the case - handy! The battery in the case also charges quickly - even via USB plugged into a laptop. Battery life of both the ear buds themselves and the case are also good. I was able to charge the ear buds several times (didn't count) before needing to charge the case again.
Sound quality is good both for podcasts and music with good bass level for ear buds - better than other ear buds I have used.
The buttons on the ear buds are flush and work well for the controls syncing to my phone.
Delivery was quick - had them in 2 days with Prime.
Overall I am very satisfied with these ear buds, especially at this price point! I would buy them again.

Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2023
These headphones are great. I was never sure that I would like the Earbuds that wrap around my ears. But these are extremely comfortable. I did use the larger tips. (A set of three is included) The fit was surprisingly comfortable. I like the feel much better than my others that are supposed to magically stay put in my ears. These stay comfortably and snuggly attached to the ear. No more having them fall out while exercising. The control is great because there are easy to find physical push buttons which means you cannot accidentally touch the wrong spot and have the music stop or change. Quite easy to answer incoming phone calls with these as well. The sound performance is particularly good. If you get them sealed in your ears correctly there is a full range of bass and clear highs. The seal does create a seal which suppresses noise. I used them in the pool for a workout and they worked fine. They do last a long time on a charge. I have never used them long enough for them to need recharging during a full day. They recharge easily in the case which has a clear display, and it has a built-in battery to charge on the go when necessary. I am not sure how many recharges there are in the case before it needs recharging. The case recharges with an included USB-C cable. There is a Flashing LED that shows until charged. My set is black as pictured. The size is palm sized. It is easy to hold on to them and they will easily fit in your pocket or purse. They were quite easy to pair with my phone. They are in pairing mode when taken out of the case the first time. Their construction is very solid, and they should last a long time.

Very good headphones for the price. I walk a lot and I only use one ear bud so I can hear the traffic around me. These are pretty good because I am able to hear my music really well over the traffic and I don't have the other bud dangling from me during my walks.

217,Returned After 3 Uses...Making a 2nd Attempt Though - UPDATE,"Verified Purchase
I had been looking for wireless headphones for a while and was not interested in Air Pods so when I saw these I was immediately interested. I read the reviews on all items before I purchase and the vast majority of them for these headphones were positive so I thought I would give them a try....for the price it wouldn't really hurt.
When they arrived, I immediately opened them up and set about charging them. I left them alone until all the lights were lit indicating they were charged. I then paired them with my phone (an Android) and my iPad. They paired very easily and I used them to watch a Ted Talk and the sound quality was good and they were very comfortable. I put them back on the charger and planned on using them when I mowed my lawn the next day.
The next day, put them in and turned on Sirius XM and they paired instantly. About 10 minutes into mowing my lawn, the left earbud gave the low battery alert and then shut off instantly. The right one was still working fine so I just took out the left and finished my work. I thought maybe the connection in the case wasn't good so I put it on the charger to give it another chance.
I pulled them out the next day to use when I was doing some writing and again paired quickly but this time to my laptop. The sound quality was again good and no issues....and then 10 minutes later the left one gave the low battery alert and immediately shut off. They had been on the charger for over 12 hours at that point so I knew I had a defective earbud.
While I am returning them, I am going to give another pair a try before I give up completely. I will update after the second set arrives...I want to at least give them another shot because the sound quality and comfort were great
UPDATE - I received a new pair and thus far they have been great. No issues with this pair and the company have been great to work with.

I will update after the second set arrives...I want to at least give them another shot because the sound quality and comfort were great UPDATE - I received a new pair and thus far they have been great. No issues with this pair and the company have been great to work with. I would definitely recommend these earbuds...very comfortable, easy to pair, and the sound quality is great.

398,Great For My Late Night TV Watching,"I got these headphones for one primary purpose and that was to use them with my TV. They were easy to pair via bluetooth and had them up and working in a very short time after charging them up.
For my use, I really liked them. The sound was good, I wore them for an 8-hour stretch and my ears weren't bothered at all. I used them while watching TV and with my Xbox through my TV.
There's a little bit of a delay using them to play Xbox through the TV connection, but that isn't unusual given that I wasn't using them directly with the Xbox itself. I believe the only way to do that with these would be to use the included cord to connect it to the audio jack in the controller. There was no delay while watching TV and the audio was in sync.
I also like how these fold inward to be more compact for storage. Given the price point, I did not have an unreasonable expectation of them being a high end headphone set, but for how I use them, the sound is good, they are comfortable on my head, and I'm quite happy with these.",T-Lo,2023-07-04,5,,True,True,0,False,8-hour stretch|watching tv|tv connection|included cord|price point|unreasonable expectation|audio jack|play xbox|primary purpose|easy to pair|pair via bluetooth|short time|time after charging|play Xbox|good|sound|delay|working,0,"Great For My Late Night TV Watching.

These buds, with a magnetic charging case, ease of connectivity, waterproof, comfortable, secure fit, and darn good sound make this a great choice. I'm a bit of an audiophile and, for the price, I admit I was more than skeptical. However, I decided to trust the heavily weighted positive reviews before purchasing. I am very pleased indeed.

Update 6/20/20: For those that have complained the buds fall out, you have not taken the time to find the right ones to fit your ears. (personally, I like the small round ""foam"" ones best. ). For those that say the sound sucks, it's because you've not inserted them into your ears correctly. They have to be properly (and deeply) fitted/inserted to get good fidelity.

28,I'm really happy with them,"I purchased the old model of these headphones (the B16 Bluetooth headphones from Boloxa) because I wanted a reasonably priced option for wireless headphones. I've absolutely loved them so the A17 model seemed like a perfect upgrade. The sound profile of my old headphones is rich and full. They turn on when you take them out of the case and turn off when you put them back in. They also stay in my ears reliably.
When I heard about the A17 model, I became interested in having an option that wraps around my ear for even better security during exercise. Even though the B16s stay in fairly well, I have to adjust them and push them in every now and then to make sure they aren't going to fall out. The A17 model felt like a good option for going running and extended use so I went ahead and bought them to try out.
The A17s have just arrived and I'm really happy to find the same quality sound that I love from my B16 headphones. I seriously don't understand why anyone would pay more money for bluetooth headphones when you can get this kind of rich sound out of something so accessibly priced. They A17 headphones have buttons on them that allow for more control (volume, skipping a track, answering a call and more) without having to interact with your phone or whatever the headphones are connected to. It's going to take me a while to memories the controls (press twice for next track, long press for volume change, press both to answer a call etc.) Once it's in my head I think I will have a lot of fun with this feature but it is a little tricky to master at first.
This is my first pair of headphones that hug the ear like these do, and they are quite comfortable. I always worried that they would scratch or squeeze my ear but I can barely feel them when they are on.
The only way to turn off my old headphones is to return them to the case. This means that if I forgot my case somewhere far, I have to just let the batteries run down. I don't have this issue with the new A17 headphones! All I have to do is press the button on both ears for 5 seconds and they will turn off so I don't have to find the case to keep them from running out of battery.

127,These affordable earbuds have luxury quality.,"Verified Purchase
I received these earbuds within 2 days and they are as described. For an affordable price, I am very impressed by these earbuds.
Inside the box, you get earbuds, a charging case, charging cable, and different earbud sizes. A cool feature these have is that they stick to the case with magnets (Yeah, b****, magnets) so they cannot fall out of the case.
Once in your ear, they do not feel like they are falling out or that they're hurting your ears. I have had other earbuds that are painful after about an hour.
The range on these earbuds was very good, about 35 feet. That lets me listen to these earbuds away from my phone, in almost every room in my apartment. The sounds on these bad boys was impressive. I have a pair of Hyphen earbuds I got about a year ago, and these are just as clear and loud as those, and do not fall out of my ear (bonus).
The setup was a piece of cake. I didn't do anything except take them out of their case, and search for them from my phone.
The call quality could be slightly better, but these are about as good as you get with an in-ear wireless earbud for call quality. I have not found a pair of wireless earbuds that work amazingly for calls. Even my wired over the ear noise canceling headphones have so so quality for calls. I would give these a definite thumbs up for call quality.
I highly recommend these wireless earbuds for anyone searching for some affordably priced wireless headphones that are as good as the higher priced name brands! I used them on walks/hikes (whatever outdoor activities we can legally do in this Pandemic) and they do what they say they will do.
The only thing I wish these earbuds/case had was if the case could charge wirelessly.
Having my older Hyphen wireless earbuds case charge wirelessly was a benefit, because I don't have a lot of micro usb cables anymore with the new usb c cables on phones and laptops. But that is just nitpicking.
Overall, I am very happy with these Beben earbuds.",shawn hermes,2020-08-17,5,black,False,True,0,True,in-ear wireless earbud|earbud sizes|verified purchase|affordable price|charging cable|cool feature|bad boys|year ago|work amazingly|definite thumbs|highly recommend|higher priced|outdoor activities|charge wirelessly|hyphen earbuds|beben earbuds|charging case|Verified Purchase|call quality|good|calls|Hyphen wireless earbuds|magnets|Hyphen earbuds|phone,1,"These affordable earbuds have luxury quality..

I used them on walks/hikes (whatever outdoor activities we can legally do in this Pandemic) and they do what they say they will do. The only thing I wish these earbuds/case had was if the case could charge wirelessly. Having my older Hyphen wireless earbuds case charge wirelessly was a benefit, because I don't have a lot of micro usb cables anymore with the new usb c cables on phones and laptops. But that is just nitpicking. Overall, I am very happy with these Beben earbuds.",train

I really like this headset as my first pair and wireless Bluetooth headset. It took some time to get used to but to be honest they comfortable to use and I sometimes forget them in my ear.

113,The Sleeper Brand of Ear Buds,"Verified Purchase
I have been through a few pairs of true wireless ear buds and wasn't a fan of the fit for most (one bud would fit while the other falls out). These fit great and with the different included tips, you can swap out and customize your fit for both buds or a single bud [if your ear canals differ in size like mine do].
Sound is good. I'm still trying to find my happy place with adjusting my EQ app on the phone to balance the sound on this pair. Bass is great, mids and highs are crisp. Initially, these seem to be on the quiet side, but with that said, I haven't balanced out my personal sound profile on my phone.
When I saw photos of this product in the reviews here [on Amazon], I wasn't impressed because it looked like cheap plastic. On top of that, it's a brand I never heard of. I found out they are far more superior in quality in person. They just don't photograph well. The case is hefty. It's very solid, well protected with a magnetized clamshell lid. It's not going shatter if you drop it. The exterior of the case has a rubberized coating. This was not mentioned in other peer reviews. To me, that impressed me. It means they designed it to provide extra grip versus the slick or cheaper matte finishes. This will also hide fingerprints, too. The buds are plastic, however they are of a higher quality material with no loose parts or gaps in the ear bud cases themselves. The packaging presentation is on par with a higher end product. This isn't something seen at a $31 price point (as of this writing). The closest you could get to these may be the JLab Go Air, but those don't have an enclosed case nor does it offer WIRELESS CHARGING. Yes, if you have a wireless charging pad, then these are the buds to buy. You will be hard pressed to find a pair in this range that offers that.
I will update this review after a few weeks of testing them and getting a better gauge of the battery life. These seem to be on average with other buds in the price range.
UPDATE #1 (4/7/2020): after still having some issues with fit despite trying all the ear tips, I reversed the ear buds. They have a slight angle and for some reason, the left and right earbuds would not totally stay in the corresponding ears they were meant for. Out of frustration this morning, I put them in reversed to see if the right fit the left ear and vice versa with the other ear.
Sure enough, they actually fit better when worn reversed. They stay sealed and do not budge (moving about, talking, yawning, etc). If you are still struggling with the fit, REVERSE THE EAR BUDS (R in left ear, L in right ear). The angle is actually better this way and will lock into you ear better, plus no discomfort. This largely depends on your ear shape, but it's worth a shot.

181,Don’t even think about it….JUST BUY THESE!,"Verified Purchase
If I could give these 10 stars, I would. I don’t usually write many reviews, but when something is this good, I feel that I have to. I was not expecting them to be as good as they are considering the low price. I enjoy listening to music with earphones and, as a result, usually use the Sony WH-1000 xm3 set that I have. Between the noise cancellation and the sound quality of them, they are a fantastic pair of earphones. You are free to not believe me but, I would say that these BEBEN ear buds come surprisingly close to the Sonys…certainly not the same sound quality for sure, but better than any other ear buds I have ever tried. No, I was not compensated by BEBEN nor did I receive anything free from them for saying this. I usually listen to the beginning of ZZ Top’s “Poor Boy” for a test of the bass, and to some triangles in the classical music that I enjoy for the highs. There was plenty of tight bass for the first (certainly not all of it) and the highs were crystal clear for the second. It’s almost like I got a pair of Sennheisers by mistake. It is key, however, to be sure that you put the correct size rubber tips on them so they fit as snugly as possible in your ear to hear the sound at its’ best. They fit my ear very well, they stay in, they charge quickly and they sound great.

162,100% IMPRESSED and AMAZED!! Amazing Sound and Ultra Comfortable.,"Verified Purchase
I was skeptical purchasing these at first. But I have to say these tiny earbuds have SUPERB sound quality. Not only do they both work simultaneously for Media, Music and Phone Calls but they can be used one at a time (independently) also which is nice for using as a Bluetooth headset for phone calls. Phone calls are CRYSTAL clear on both ends. They have an extremely low profile and do not look all big and bulky in the ear which was a huge plus as well ... Another cool thing is that they seem to fit and seal inside the ear perfectly cancelling all outside noise. It literally feels like you are in your own little world!!! Pairing literally is instant and no hassle ! The charger is also pretty nice ... Its a rubber coated round tiny charger / case wich is water resistant and TINY and doubles as a keychain =D !!! It can be charged with any MICRO USB charger which is also awesome, eliminating the need to carry an extra charger or special adapter etc. I have indeed purchased other sets for more money as well as a few others in the same price point and these are by far my favorite set now . I have literally never had a set that exceeded my expectations like these have .

49,Amazing experience as always,"I recently purchased the BOLOXR Wireless Sports Headphones and I must say, I'm thrilled with my decision. Having been impressed with the results of their previous wired version, I was eager to try out their wireless offering. And I'm glad I did. These headphones are everything I expected from the company and more.
First and foremost, the sleek design caught my attention. They have a modern and stylish look that I absolutely love. But it's not just about aesthetics; these headphones are also incredibly comfortable. I can wear them for extended periods without feeling any discomfort or irritation.
The battery life is another standout feature. I've been using these headphones on the treadmill for about a week now, with each session lasting close to 30 minutes, and I haven't had to charge them yet. The long-lasting battery is a huge plus for me, as I don't have to worry about running out of power during my workouts.
One thing worth mentioning is that the case is a bit heavier than I expected. However, for someone like me who tends to lose things easily, this actually works in my favor. The weight makes it less likely for me to misplace the case, so I consider it a positive aspect.

30,Amazing Bluetooth Headphones for Running,"I recently purchased these Bluetooth headphones, and I must say they have exceeded all my expectations! As an avid runner, finding the perfect pair of headphones that stay in place, sync effortlessly, and remain comfortable throughout my workouts has been a challenge. However, these headphones have completely changed the game for me.
The first thing that impressed me was the snug and secure fit. They come with multiple ear tips, allowing me to choose the perfect size that fits my ears perfectly. No matter how intense my runs get, these headphones stay firmly in place, eliminating any worries of them falling out or needing constant readjustments.
Syncing these headphones with my phone was a breeze. The Bluetooth connectivity is exceptionally stable, and the pairing process is almost instantaneous. No more frustrating connection dropouts during my workouts; it's just smooth, uninterrupted music to keep me motivated and focused.
Comfort is a crucial factor for me during extended runs, and I couldn't be happier with the lightweight design and soft ear tips of these headphones. Even during long-distance runs, I forget I'm wearing them, as they don't cause any discomfort or irritation.
The sound quality is fantastic, delivering clear, crisp audio with deep bass that energizes my runs. The noise isolation is impressive too, effectively blocking out distractions from my surroundings.
Overall, I highly recommend these Bluetooth headphones to any fellow runners or fitness enthusiasts. They offer an impeccable fit, seamless syncing, and unbeatable comfort, making them the ultimate companion for your workout sessions.

I could return them if I was disappointed. I ordered them. They literally showed up the next day! (surprise #1) I'm not incredibly tech savvy, so I was apprehensive about the setup. I worried for nothing. They practically paired themselves to my phone. There were soooo many sizes of covers to choose from. (surprise #2) I found the size that fit my ear best and in they went. When I turned my music on I couldn't believe the sound quality and bass. (surprise #3) The noise cancelling was fantastic too. If I could change anything at all, it would be a little extra room in the case to hold the small charging cable and extra covers.

20,Great Headphones,"I ordered and received these headphones with great anticipation. Not to belittle the rest of this review, but I really like these headphones. A lot of it for reasons of personal taste as well.
Not a lot of people will be too particular about the button on the sides of them; but let me tell you, there is a big difference between having to press something very hard into your ear for it to register, and to just lightly touch it. A lot of times with more carelessly designed headphones the earbud will straight up press a sharp point into your inner ear (ouch).
These headphones have been designed to where the pressure spreads out all three your ear, and the result is that it is barely a pressure felt from using the button. Also, I preferred the precision of a button over the and precise happenstance of the touch button was features so popular now (the only reason I can see for designing them that way is that it is easier for them to be made waterproof). These also are waterproof without having to rely on that negative item.
Okay, now for the more basic stuff. The sound is very good. It’s so good to the point that I may attach them to my monitor and use them just for watching stuff online (I’m not so worried about the sound quality on watching YouTube videos and music and such). But if you want to know one thing about these headphones, you cannot ask for better sound for the price.
The battery life is fine. It does not say in the instructions or anything, but is about eight hours at maximum volume. I did not time it or anything like that. So please do your own research.

This product is PHENOMENAL. I use them for meditations, and they are great at blocking out 90% of noise, which I love. The only times noise isn’t canceled is in the case of high traffic noise and when someone is yelling to get your attention. For a closer reference, they do block out the sound of my sewing machine, which is heavy duty and rather loud so I’m very happy with them!
It does have 3 sound settings, equilibrium, vocal, and bass mode, which are all phenomenal for different reasons. I primarily use vocal mode for podcast, and bass mode for music.
I do sleep on my side, and I do move quite a bit in my sleep. Despite this, the headphones are VERY sturdy and despite my mistreatment (LOL) and ADHD brain tossing them everywhere, they are holding up like they are brand new.

They are great ear buds they are loud and the music is always crisp and clear. They fit in my ear just great and the ear hooks are what I need because air pods fall out on me. As for the microphone function it is great and I can hear the people I’m talking to and they can hear me and doesn’t sound like a tin can and eliminates much of the background noise. It has a long battery life with double led displays showing all battery strengths. I would recommend getting another pair for my family. Since my purchase I get in the car in the morning and the phone pairs to the car's audio system. When I get to work, I park the car, reach into my bag and take out either the left or the right bud, and put it in my ear. It turns on and connects immediately, with audible notifications, and the music automatically switches from the car to the bud without any button pushes. Then I just turn off the car and go. It is easy to pause the music with a single tap to the outside of the bud. The buds have other touch controls, but I never use them because the Apple Watch serves as a remote for the phone's music app. I am able to make phone calls with either bud, so each one has a mic. The iPhone automatically defaults to use the buds for calls, so I can easily receive calls by answering and hanging up using my watch or the phone itself, although there are controls that will allow one to answer and hang up using taps on the buds.. I can also use talk to text on the watch or the phone. The music automatically resumes when the mic is no longer being used. I can also summon Siri using ""Hey Siri."".The case is nice but a bit bulky but nice to have wireless charging.
Battery: The battery will not make it through eight hours of continuous play, but the case charges the bud quickly and you can get a few more hours after only a 15-minute charge. I charge the case once a week, which takes 2 hours. The case also has an indicator that tells you the approximate battery life remaining on the case. It tells you the percentage of charge from what I have experienced. When the battery gets low, a voice comes on to remind you, and it is very persistent, even when you pause the music. So you really have to put the bud back in the case.
Fit: I was amazed at how well these fit. I am 5'6"" and I have a small head, so I thought my ears would be too small. The buds come with size adjustment inserts, but I tried them and they didn't improve the fit. The inserts that came pre-installed worked fine. They stay in place with the ear hooks.I don't feel any discomfort after wearing them for a 10-hour shift.
Sound: I don't know much about sound quality relative to the big name brands. I know what music should sound like, and I feel that these supply a rich, balanced sound and good volume level with very little grain or background noise. I know that if I wear both buds and turn the volume up, I will be in my own little world.

81,Great headphones,"So what’s great about these?
1. Fit perfect in the ear, especially when running or working out.
2. Price is great since I usually lose my headphones at least one a month.
3. The deep base and the noise is really rich.
4. Along with standard soft tip ear piece, the two extra pieces included are perfect for smaller ears, like my kids
5. Lastly, the battery has been better than expected. Most of my older headphones would last only a 2 hours, but these are lasting on the higher end of 6 hours continuously.

The A17 Bluetooth Headphones Stereo Sound by Boloxa has really given me a better option in headphones. Low profile while in the ear and the charging cradle is straight forward, connect it to a USB port and forget about it. I have a variety of Bluetooth headphones, from over the ear to in the ear to sports and these A17 do bring these styles into one. I enjoy switching from each style depending on the environment I'm in (office/home) and now that these A17 have a combined style I can stick to using 1 longer, especially with the long battery life.

So what's great about these? 1. Fit perfect in the ear, especially when running or working out. 2. Price is great since I usually lose my headphones at least one a month. 3. The deep base and the noise is really rich. 4. Along with standard soft tip ear piece, the two extra pieces included are perfect for smaller ears, like my kids 5. Lastly, the battery has been better than expected. Most of my older headphones would last only a 2 hours, but these are lasting on the higher end of 6 hours continuously. Electrical Controls Engineer 5.0 out of 5 stars BOLOXA does it again! Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2023 The A17 Bluetooth Headphones Stereo Sound by Boloxa has really given me a better option in headphones. Low profile while in the ear and the charging cradle is straight forward, connect it to a USB port and forget about it. I have a variety of Bluetooth headphones, from over the ear to in the ear to sports and these A17 do bring these styles into one. I enjoy switching from each style depending on the environment I'm in (office/home) and now that these A17 have a combined style I can stick to using 1 longer, especially with the long battery life. One of the major features I like about these is that each unit comes with a control button which means I can pause the music from either my left ear or the right ear and continue with the other unit.

I love these headphones! They have amazing sound and when you wear them, you can barely hear anything outside of them! I mow my lawn with then in and I barely hear the mower! The biggest problem I have experienced though is the mic. When I sit in a quiet room or in my car while it's off, the person on the other side can hear me great! But as soon as I go where there is any background noise, the mic starts picking up everything in the background and I kind of cut out pretty frequently.

175,Surprised in a good way,"Verified Purchase
For $30, these are an excellent pair of true wireless earphones.
Pros:
- Price is solid
- Better sound quality than expected. Definitely near the top in quality for this price bracket. Bass heavy but not excessive.
- IP68 means you can shower/bathe with these, as well as light swimming.
(Diving isn't recommended due to the signal being cut off by water)
- Comes with a total of six eartip sizes. I picked the largest for the best isolation/security of fit.
Cons:
- Only passive noise isolation, no active
- Limited button function (holding the Control button increases volume, but you need to use your phone or voice assistant to turn the volume down). Can pause, play, skip/repeat songs, and take/end/reject calls. I usually use buttons primarily for play/pause and for adjusting volume, so this is a con for me.
- Micro USB instead of USB C in 2020
Other observations:
- Charging case is relatively lightweight, and about the size of a mandarin orange
- These are definitely mid-range and bass leaning. The treble isn't terrible, but just a bit understated, especially around the mid-treble area. It'll be up to you if you're fine with this. Practically speaking, it makes these earphones better for hip hop, electronica, etc. Rock/metal sounds okay, but a lot of the guitar and vocals take a step back over bass and drums, unless it's a very high note.
- Soundstage is what you'd expect from $30 earphones, nothing impressive. That's not why you're buying these though, hopefully.
I received this pair for free for an honest review. I've tried multiple earphones in this price range as well as owning and regularly using headphones in the $300+ range, to give you context.

184,Nice little wireless earbuds (waterproof!),"Verified Purchase
I bought these earbuds with the intention of walking on the treadmill at the gym because I was getting tire of my old wired headphones snagging on everything and getting ripped out of my ear-holes! The first thing I got to appreciate with these earbuds was the quick charging they get when placed in the magnetic holding case. The case plugs into your standard mini USB charging block that you use with your phone. In no time at all they get charged up and last multiple workout sessions before needing to be recharged, which is never a problem as I just keep the charging case plugged in all the time next to my smart watches' charging dock and put them in there when I get home for safe keeping. The sound is actually pretty good for the type of music I listen to when working out (pop and classic rock music) and get as loud as I feel comfortable with. Their wireless range stretches as far as I'd ever need it to go as I'm never more than a few meters from my phone (android). The general quality of these earbuds feels pretty high and they come with multiple rubber ear caps to match the size of ear canals that you have (small/medium/large). The instructions say you can even swim with them since they are waterproof (which I can't wait to do because it will feel so wrong but be so cool to listen to music in the water).

108,Skeptical at first...,"Verified Purchase
- EXPECTATION: I bought these hoping to get a good set of wireless earbuds that could charge easily and quickly, not fall out of my ears, connect to my android phone no problem, and withstand water enough to shower and exercise. I literally got all of this in one package! I've had these for over two weeks and I really love them. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for the same things.
- ACCESSORIES: The buds charge in a magnetic case that is round, small, lightweight, and portable. It comes with a braided wrist loop (optional) in case you want to attach it to a bag or something. The buds snap into place to charge, and they charge instantly and automatically when the case has some battery to it (and you charge the case via the included microUSB cable). Also, I found it super helpful because they included SO MANY earbud replacement squishies. My ears are fairly small and I imagine such an assortment of squishies could fit anyone's preferences.
- SHOWER/EXERCISE/USE: I've run with these and taken showers in these. Both buds are working as perfectly as they did the first day. I love to work in these because I don't have to worry about tripping over wires, having my phone fall out of my pocket and pulling my earbuds out, getting the wires in the sink doing dishes, or trying to aim my voice at the tiny microphone box on my old wired earbuds.
- PAIRING: Using the buttons on these is really intuitive if you've used any technology before. One click is pause, two clicks is go forward/skip, etc. Pairing is relatively easy too. I had a little trouble at first getting them to pair at the same time, but there are instructions included that address this issue. I like that when I walk outside (I only wear one bud when I'm outside so I can stay more alert to traffic) all the sound goes through the one earbud I'm using. I can leave the other earbud in its case charging at my house. No issues with this at all!
- CALLS: One time I was outside on a windy day and my sister started to call me and I was concerned that she wouldn't be able to hear me (this was the first time I was taking a call with the earbuds). Piece of cake! She heard me fine through the one earbud I was using and I didn't have to press any buttons or worry about anything.
- OVERALL: Love this product! Got so excited that I bought my brother some and he loves them too. He can lift weights now without worrying about the wires and can talk to his friends more easily. Literally the only issue with them that I have is that they're so small and convenient, I have them in all the time. And they're so compact that sometimes other people can't tell I'm wearing them! They see me apparently talking to myself like a crazy person or they'll try to talk to me and I can't hear them 'cause I'm jamming' to music :)",AyR,2020-04-29,5,black,False,False,0,True,braided wrist loop|fit anyone's preferences|tiny microphone box|included microusb cable|earbud replacement squishies|verified purchase|super helpful|instructions included|sister started|lift weights|apparently talking|crazy person|buds snap|charge instantly|phone fall|wired earbuds|windy day|magnetic case|case charging|fairly small|buds charge|charge easily|Verified Purchase|good set|set of wireless|withstand water|EXPECTATION|wireless earbuds|android phone|time|love|exercise|shower|wires,1,"Skeptical at first....

Both buds are working as perfectly as they did the first day. I love to work in these because I don't have to worry about tripping over wires, having my phone fall out of my pocket and pulling my earbuds out, getting the wires in the sink doing dishes, or trying to aim my voice at the tiny microphone box on my old wired earbuds. - PAIRING: Using the buttons on these is really intuitive if you've used any technology before. One click is pause, two clicks is go forward/skip, etc. Pairing is relatively easy too. I had a little trouble at first getting them to pair at the same time, but there are instructions included that address this issue. I like that when I walk outside (I only wear one bud when I'm outside so I can stay more alert to traffic) all the sound goes through the one earbud I'm using. I can leave the other earbud in its case charging at my house. No issues with this at all! - CALLS: One time I was outside on a windy day and my sister started to call me and I was concerned that she wouldn't be able to hear me (this was the first time I was taking a call with the earbuds). Piece of cake! She heard me fine through the one earbud I was using and I didn't have to press any buttons or worry about anything. - OVERALL: Love this product! Got so excited that I bought my brother some and he loves them too. He can lift weights now without worrying about the wires and can talk to his friends more easily. Literally the only issue with them that I have is that they're so small and convenient, I have them in all the time. And they're so compact that sometimes other people can't tell I'm wearing them! They see me apparently talking to myself like a crazy person or they'll try to talk to me and I can't hear them 'cause I'm jamming' to music :)",train

173,Meets Expectations- of a pair of 30$ wireless waterproof earbuds,"Verified Purchase
I've had them for 2-3 months, and the button on the left earbud stopped working after the first few weeks, but the sound still plays fine in both, so it's not the biggest deal. The only annoying part of that is that I can't power them both on if I don't have the case on hand because, since the left one doesn't respond to the button, it only turns on when taken out of the case because the earbuds are programmed to do that automatically.
Other than that, the sound quality has been fine, the battery life is a little hard to pinpoint, but I can say that they charge very quickly for sure, and plus the case is also a huge battery booster and it's easy to carry around. I have not submerged the earbuds, but they've survived like 70 showers with the only damage being the unresponsive button. I only have one other issue with them, and that's that the earbuds, while not uncomfortable, can be pretty loose. I don't know if it's my ears or how I turn my head, but when I'm in the shower my left ear always fills up with water that gets on the inside of the earbud, and aside from being annoying, ends up with the bud falling out. (I've always caught it when it falls; the damage to the left earbud is not a drop, it is water damage)
Sure, I have two complaints. BUT at this price point (around 30$ when I purchased) it's perfectly fine. I'd rather give four and half stars, and only take off the half-star because of the unresponsive left-earbud, but I can't.

112,Superior sound and do not fall out!,"Verified Purchase
All I can say is: you need to get these headphones! The quality in the design, fit, and sound is impressive.
I am always looking for the *perfect* pair of headphones that fit in my ears well, aren’t heavy, and don’t fall out after considerable wear throughout a day. I do a lot of talking throughout the day for work as well as use them for yardwork on the weekends. Every pair of headphones I seem to purchase only fits well for a short period of time and ends up falling out after talking for only 30 minutes. Enter the Beben X8 headphones!
The box comes with SIX sets of earbud tips that are sure to conform to your personal ear. This seems to always be my problem, but it’s not an issue with these headphones. In addition, the packaging contains the headphone, the charging/carry case, a (short) MicroUSB cable, and a lanyard attachment for your charging/carrying case. It is a nice compact design for easy transport or storage.
The pairing process is easy, but you first need to PULL OFF THE PLASTIC on the underside of each ear bud that protects it from the charging pins in the case. Before you charge the units or use them, make sure to do this so you aren’t frustrated after you realize it “isn’t charging.”
The sound quality is superb. The deep bass and clear audio is great for nearly any music type. Adjusting the volume is a breeze, simply hold down on the left to adjust volume down and hold down the button on the right bud to increase the volume. Want to go backward to the previous song? Just double tap the right ear bud. If you want to forward to the next song, double tap the left ear bud. Want to access your preferred Assistant? Just triple-tap the left earbud.
Pros:
-Compact design
-Great packaging that includes numerous earbuds
-Lightweight
-Stays put in your ear for extended periods of time, even when there is significant jaw movement
-Sound quality is great
-Call quality is pretty good for both callers
-Great with Zoom for conference calls!
-1 Year warranty
-Easy Pairing and setup (Android / Windows – iOS not tested)
Cons:
-No audio passthrough/amplification so you can “hear” the sounds around you
-Only able to see that the case Is charging/charged when connected to a cable by opening the case lid to view LEDs. No external LEDs
-No auto pause of audio when buds are removed from ears
Overall, I am extremely pleased with these headphones. The sound quality is far better than anticipated and they hold strong in my ears without budging. These are the real deal in terms of ergonomics and sound quality. There are a few items left to be desired as noted in my Cons list, but these aren’t deal breakers by any means.

92,Seamless connection to smartphone,"I've tried plenty of in-ear or wrap-around headphones, but these have by far been the simplest I've used. I literally took them out of the box, put them into my ears, and opened my smart phone's bluetooth menu. They made an audible ""pairing"" sound and were there waiting to connect within 5 seconds. With other (more expensive) pairs of headphones, I have spent minutes to hours trying to get the headphones to pair correctly, play audio out of both sides, or power on. I experienced none of those problems with these headphones. None of these features are particularly new or groundbreaking, but it is enjoyable to order an affordable pair of earphones that execute each part of the equation well.
The earphones come in a stylish, ergonomic case that leaves no confusion about how the headphones have to be placed inside in order to charge. The case fits comfortably into a purse, backpack, or even back pants pocket and also displays a few LED indicators on the inside that relay information about the charge level of each individual phone and the case battery itself. I appreciate not having to guess how much time I'll have before my headphones die, or polling their battery from within the layers-deep smartphone menu.
I also found the audio experience within multiple apps to be much easier than competitor models. I tested out and made sure that these headphones played audio by default with mobile Chrome and Firefox browser apps. They also played seamlessly with the browser version of youtube as well as the standalone Youtube app for android.
The on-ear commands are simple and not too fussy. I don't accidentally skip a track or video by errantly touching my ear, and they also have intuitive volume controls on each earphone that can be activated by a finger touch or hold. The case clasps firmly shut and has a light amount of ""stick"" or magnetism that keep it from being jostled open in my backpack or falling open when I take it quickly out.
The headphones themselves are a stylish black color, not too eye-catching, but subtle enough that they can be worn without drawing a lot of attention. The rubberized bulb on the end of the earpiece is an effective noise-canceller that drowned out a lot of the nearby sound without even having any audio playing. The effect is not total noise isolation, but it certainly helps music or audio to be heard more clearly.

72,Great Quality Headphones,"These are a great quality pair of headphones, I have cauliflower ear and these fit just fine.
I'm able to work out with these without issue and stay on and the sound quality is crystal clear. I also really like that the battery percentage is displaying within the case that way I don't have to guess. I will continue to buy this company's product as they have done me well. The case that it comes with is a bit on the larger side but I imagine its due to the good battery life it has, I've used them for over 3 hours and still going strong. I'm a fan of the hook it has as well, that way it won't fall off when running. These are definitely earbuds for athletes or those wanting a more secure feel, I recommend these. Instructions were clear and I was able to navigate the button settings, which other products typically don't have. Also comes with an extra pair of earbud pieces.

312,I replaced my worn JBL headphone with this.,"Verified Purchase
I replaced my worn JBL headphone with this. I like these better. The ear muffs are bigger and JBL has two annoying features. The Amazon/ google assistant and the feature that stops you music when you remove them. Accidentally tap the assistant and it interrupts the music. Also if you bounce around such as running the music stops.

342,Very good headphones!,"These headphones have good style. They are lightweight but feel like they could be durable. I use many different headphones and the most common place for most to break is usually the headband. This headband feels pretty flexible. Feels like a flat metal bendable strip inside the cushioned headband. They do feel comfortable. They hug my ears a tad bit but my head is larger than average and they are lightweight so it isn't that bad. They fold and the earmuffs can be turned inward instead of outward. Probably should have been the other way so when you take them off your head and put them around your around your neck the earmuffs will lay on your chest instead of the hard exterior plastic. Haven't completely tested battery life but they advertise 70 hours and a 2 hour charge time. In my opinion, if it only does 2/3s of that it's still 2 days playtime on one charge and that's amazing!

157,Blown Away!,"Verified Purchase
Purchased as a different style earbud, have an air-pod knock-off style and was just not impressed with the fit and sound was just OK. Shipping was right on time as a prime member with accepted Covid delays. First thing I noticed when unboxing was how rugged the bbx itself was, thought to myself this is a good sign. The carrier case is just as rugged, crush proof and has a solid magnetic closure. Plugged the unit in to charge after taking off the plastic separator on the earbud charging contacts. The indicator LEDs are very nice, did not have that with the last set. The pod case has 4 indicator LEDs that flash with different notifications, you can see the charge status as well.
Once everything was ready to go, making the Bluetooth connection was easy. My phone found the device instantly and the LED indicators on the earbuds flashed blue/white as it was pairing. There is also a voice notification that you can hear when turning on/off or when connecting. I kept the instructions handy as it has a complete list of commands that involves clicking the respective buttons on each earbud. That is a real plus for me as my other set involved tapping in different locations. Once I had Spotify up and running I really was not prepared for how great these sound, unbelievable! The bass is incredible and the sound is really rich. Clicking the buttons to skip songs and turn volume up/down worked well. They seal very well in the ear and completely block out any outside noise, I can't wait to use these to mow lawn! I used them for a couple of hours at a time but have not run them long enough at a time to drain the batteries yet so I can't comment on how long they actually last.

If, like me, you intend to use these for work, then these earbuds do the job. They do everything sufficiently well to be useful, and they cost a quarter to a fifth of what the most popular buds in the market cost. You can understand calls clearly, and music is ok. The microphone captures your voice sufficiently well. People have mentioned they could hear a minor background noise when I speak, but they could understand me fine. The charging case is also ok, albeit you should know that the buds come with a USB - C cable, and the case uses Micro USB, so you'll need to get your own charger. Luckily, all the non-Apple cellphones, speakers, and other tech gadgets up to a couple of years ago used to use Micro USB so you're likely to have a charger somewhere in your house already. Aesthetics are ok as well, the buds protrude significantly as you can see in the photos other people have posted in their reviews.

10,Really nice with out a big price.,"This pair of cordless earbuds from Boloxa is one of the best I have. This pair is very comfortable around my ears. The hook is well made. The hook is soft enough for the earbuds to be worn comfortably for hours. The hook does a great job of keeping your earbuds in your ear during vigorous movement like jogging or basketball. My wife has very small ears and these earbuds were very comfortable for her to wear. She is the one that turned me on to these earbuds. These earbuds came with three sizes of soft ear cones, but only one hook.
I like that the Boloxa case tells you, with an easy to read digital display, exactly how much charge you have left. It charges quickly and works with all my wireless charging pads. It is really easy to pair with my Android phone. I used my earbuds everyday for 8 hours a day and I didn't need to charge my case for 4 days.
The box comes with the charging case, two earbuds, 3 size cone tips (one on the earbuds already), a USB to c charging cord, and a booklet of instructions. The instructions contain QR codes with videos to assist with adjusting the Android volume limits on your Android phone.
I like the sound quality and it is easy to adjust the volume with the earbuds only. The controls are simple, no need to learn morse code to advance a song or pause/play, and easy to use. They even work with only one earbud at a time.
As there is a microphone in both earbuds you can talk on the phone with only one in use. I would like to see some improvement with the microphone. My wife says this pair of earbuds sounds like I'm talking in a public bathroom, all echoes. The microphone picks up any and all surrounding noises and there is not a way to set the ambiance. It would be nice if they had an app like Sony earbuds do.

If you just need a cheap pair of wireless earbuds for work, shower (Yes, shower...GAME CHANGER) working out etc...These are the way to go.

Sound quality is surprisingly great although I wish they could be a tad louder. They stay in my ear perfectly fine with several different size ear plugs to get the right fit and noise cancellation.

0,A17 great bang for your buck. And waterprooof.,"They are great ear buds they are loud and the music is always crisp and clear. They fit in my ear just great and the ear hooks are what I need because air pods fall out on me. As for the microphone function it is great and I can hear the people I’m talking to and they can hear me and doesn’t sound like a tin can and eliminates much of the background noise. It has a long battery life with double led displays showing all battery strengths. I would recommend getting another pair for my family. Since my purchase I get in the car in the morning and the phone pairs to the car's audio system. When I get to work, I park the car, reach into my bag and take out either the left or the right bud, and put it in my ear. It turns on and connects immediately, with audible notifications, and the music automatically switches from the car to the bud without any button pushes. Then I just turn off the car and go. It is easy to pause the music with a single tap to the outside of the bud. The buds have other touch controls, but I never use them because the Apple Watch serves as a remote for the phone's music app. I am able to make phone calls with either bud, so each one has a mic. The iPhone automatically defaults to use the buds for calls, so I can easily receive calls by answering and hanging up using my watch or the phone itself, although there are controls that will allow one to answer and hang up using taps on the buds.. I can also use talk to text on the watch or the phone. The music automatically resumes when the mic is no longer being used. I can also summon Siri using ""Hey Siri."".The case is nice but a bit bulky but nice to have wireless charging.
Battery: The battery will not make it through eight hours of continuous play, but the case charges the bud quickly and you can get a few more hours after only a 15-minute charge. I charge the case once a week, which takes 2 hours. The case also has an indicator that tells you the approximate battery life remaining on the case. It tells you the percentage of charge from what I have experienced. When the battery gets low, a voice comes on to remind you, and it is very persistent, even when you pause the music. So you really have to put the bud back in the case.
Fit: I was amazed at how well these fit. I am 5'6"" and I have a small head, so I thought my ears would be too small. The buds come with size adjustment inserts, but I tried them and they didn't improve the fit. The inserts that came pre-installed worked fine. They stay in place with the ear hooks.I don't feel any discomfort after wearing them for a 10-hour shift.
Sound: I don't know much about sound quality relative to the big name brands. I know what music should sound like, and I feel that these supply a rich, balanced sound and good volume level with very little grain or background noise. I know that if I wear both buds and turn the volume up, I will be in my own little world.
Overall these buds are a great value for the price and I am looking forward to enjoying my music library at work for as long as I can.",Charles,2023-07-23,5,,False,True,16,True,air pods fall|people i’m talking|car's audio system|iphone automatically defaults|pre-installed worked fine|easily receive calls|size adjustment inserts|good volume level|music automatically switches|phone's music app|music automatically resumes|sound quality relative|apple watch serves|long battery life|make phone calls|microphone function|background noise|connects immediately|audible notifications|button pushes|single tap|summon siri|hey siri|bit bulky|wireless charging|continuous play|10-hour shift|music library|ear hooks|doesn’t sound|balanced sound|phone pairs|battery strengths|touch controls|small head|bud quickly|15-minute charge|takes 2 hours|bud back|case charges|great ear buds|crisp and clear|fit|Watch|phone music,0,"A17 great bang for your buck.

1,Simple to pair to phone and High quality sound,"This is a review for the Boloxa wireless headphones A17.
My package arrived on time. I was impressed with how well the earbuds were packaged in its carrying case.
As soon as I received the A17 I carefully opened the box. I found the user manual, the charging wire, different size ear tips and the headphones in the beautiful carrying case.
The User manual is well written and easy to understand. Illustrations are great too.
Upon arrival, Earbuds appears to be charged and ready for use, but I charged the earbuds to be sure. I do like the fact that the earbuds now uses a USB – C charger. Most of the devices I own also uses USB - C charger so this makes it more convenient for me.
It was easy to pair the earbuds to my phone. No problems. And once it was paired to my phone I tried to play some tunes. It worked nicely. The sound was absolutely outstanding. Treble was great and the Bass was very good. The volume controls are simple to use. I used it for an hour for the first day and there is plenty of battery power left. I used it the following day and again still lots of batter life left again. So I can say the battery life is excellent definitely a plus cause I never remember to charge my devices..
The ear loops are great feature. They keep the earbuds in place and from falling out. This feature is very important to me. I love to exercise and other ear buds I owned without this feature were constantly falling out. In fact they were so light I almost forgot I was wearing them.
I appreciate that there are different ear tip size choices this will ensure the proper fit.
A very nice product. A feature I was not aware of at the time I purchased this A17 was the fact that it comes with a mic so I can receive calls. That is definitely a plus in my book. I thought it was just earbuds to play music while exercising or watch videos during some down time. But I am truly satisfied with this product. From the quality of sound and the ear hook feature and the simplicity of the volume up and down, all in all a great deal. The price is also a great feature too. Definitely a great value.

188,BEST WIRELESS HEADPHONES FOR THE PRICE!,"Verified Purchase
I’ve been looking for a pair of Bluetooth earbuds for a while now that I did not have to spend a lot of money on in case I lost them.
As soon as I opened up the package, I was very surprised in a GREAT way is how small the holder was in comparison to the BOSE pair that runs just north of 300.
It’s a bit big in your pocket but I’ve traveled with these on several flights, in and out of TSA, long road trips, and they work GREAT in the gym.
I still have a love affair with full over the ear headphones but for a quick grab, go, and don’t want to have too much bulk in your bag, these are great.
Even work on my EOS R camera for listening to the audio instead of a line in pair.
The battery life is amazing, charge very fast, and pair right up to your iPhone with no issues.
I’ve never used Bluetooth for cycling however these are my new favorite earbuds for cycling for 20 to 30 miles at a time in the Arizona heat, never fell out once.
And once you have them in properly with the right fittings that are included, 90% of all the outside noise is completely gone because of how much your ears are sealed off by the outside ambient noise.

It doesn't bother me because I'm not really in a situation where that was a priority, but I can tell you that they don't offer much more noise cancelling than any typical set of on ear headphones. I wore them while using a craft cutting machine and while using an electric mower (makes noise but not as much as a gas powered) and both times could def still hear all the noise- muffled of course but I did need to increase the volume of the headphones to play over it.

158,Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds - Great sound,"Verified Purchase
I like the presentation as you can see from the pictures and contents: warranty card, easy to follow directions in a foldout pamphlet, usb cable for charging and 4 sets of padded ear piece covers to fit every ear size along with the earbuds which came 3/4 charged. I used a different usb cable that was 3 feet long to charge to full charge. The wireless earbuds were charged to full within 1 hr. You have to for sure read the directions to know to take off the tiny tiny plastic cover over the charging pins on the earpiece to be able to pair to your device. Easily paired with iphone 8plus. The sound is better than another pair I already own. The sound is clear. I walked away from my device up to 30 feet without any interference or drop of quality in sound from my device. I was listening to a movie while I work remote and walked away to put something up in a closet. I have had them on now for 6 hours and still going strong on battery life. the directions say 5 hours of listening time and 70 hours of standby time. I keep waiting to hear the power low notification. The earbuds are very comfortable I tried both and then I went with just one so I can hear for other sounds in the house. The earbuds fit solid in my tiny ear canal and seals out noises around me. The quality of the sound is pretty incredible for $30 wireless earbuds. They also have a couple of iOS only directions to access siri which my others do not have this feature. Buy these I know you will not be disappointed in the quality of these bluetooth wireless earbuds. They are also waterproof so you could listen to tunes or the news in the shower.

Buy these I know you will not be disappointed in the quality of these bluetooth wireless earbuds. They are also waterproof so you could listen to tunes or the news in the shower. You can't dive with them though besides I don't know why you would want to wear them while diving. Great distance of at least 25-30 feet without dropping the quality of sound or disconnecting. I am very pleased with my purchase",train

93,Gold Standard,"These ear buds are tied with only one other choice going forward! But both are the same store's products. Let's start with some highlights here. First they arrived quickly! Getting started using them took less than 30 seconds! Just remove them from their case, remove the clear film, turn them on with the button on the side, pressing until you see a light flash, find them listed as A17 on your device Bluetooth, and press connect! Easy! Plus they will auto reconnect to the last paired device each time they are removed from the case. Love the sound quality because it's crisp and clean while not being so loud it hurts the ears. Don't get discouraged if you like them loud though because they do pack a punch and when wearing both ear buds, if you want block all other sounds they will do just that! They stay put and you never feel like you need to readjust once they are in. I was lucky and the soft tips that came on the ear buds for me perfectly but if they don't work for you there are other sizes included! And then there is the battery... it's like the energizer, they just keep playing and playing. So while these mighty little things played for a full 8 hrs, I still didn't get the message that the battery was low! When I did charge them afterwards it was only about 1.5 hours for them to be full and the case itself holds 4-5 charges. Since you CAN opt to listen with one ear bud at a time while the other one charges, and if my calculations are correct, you could potentially listen for 16 hrs a day or more and STILL only have to recharge your case one additional time per week! Phone calls were crisp and clean with no difficulty in either party hearing the other. Comes with easy directions for how to press the left or right button to serve your needs. I have to also state that These have the large button on the face that pause/play/answer/hangup/ fast forward... does it all. Volume down on left button- long press, volume top on right button- long press... that's the only difference been the two.

12,Quality and comfort at an affordable price,"I am not sure if I am like many people, but I have trouble finding a set of earbuds that I can use without them falling out of my ears.

The headset has a sleek design and are lightweight. The included instructions are clear and well thought out to show the use of all the features of the Boloxa A17 headset.

• They turn on when you take them out of the case and turn off when you put them back in.
• They also stay in my ears comfortably and reliably no matter what angle my head may be in they stay snug and comfortable
• The case has wireless charging capability that works quite well. No need to reposition precisely in one location on a pad
• The buttons for control are large and easily useable even with large fingers.
• There is a charging indicator light on the outside of the case so you can tell it is charging and uses USB-C so I can use the same cable as my phone to charge them.
• The battery life of this headset it amazing. The case provides charge boost when not in use and a single case charge lasts for days.

194,Perfect Upgrade,"Verified Purchase
I am an audiophile and am almost constantly listening to audiobooks and podcasts. I had a couple of separate earbuds similar to these before but they eventually died, broke, or I lost them. I was looking for a replacement and this definitely is what I was looking for.
I love the charging case which is also waterproof. This keeps me from losing the earbuds and makes sure they are always charged. The waterproofing prevents me from worrying about it. The case is small enough to fit in a pocket. It is a smidge bulky but not too bad.
The earbuds are great as well. I use them separately as I like only using one at a time. I tried another earbud set with touch activation rather than a button, but the problem with those is they were too sensitive and would be activated by hair, accidental brushes, and water in the shower. These earbuds have a button so it is very hard to accidentally turn it on. I also love how they turn on a pair just by removing from the case and power off when you replace them. This is great as I don't have to manually turn them on or off and can just pop them into my ear.

*I received a complimentary set of earbuds for review*
At first listen, I was fully prepared to submit a very unfavorable review on these earbuds. They sounded horrible (over-emphasized highs and very little bass), and they would NOT stay in my ears. I was searching for positive things to say about them just to soften the blow. BUT...
...then I realized that it wasn’t the fault of the earbuds. Operator error was the culprit! It turns out that all I needed to do was to make sure to properly insert the earbuds, with the body oriented up, not down. It made all the difference in the world. Now I hear much more balanced sound, and the earbuds are safely nestled in my ears. The question now is whether you will trust the rest of my review, since I am clearly a dolt.
I’ve used these for several days now, just to be sure of how I feel about them. The packaging was good (although the packing consisted of putting the nicely done product box into a much larger box with nothing done to ensure that it didn’t bounce around in transit). The charging/carry case is nice, and the ‘buds charged with no issue. Pairing was simple, the way pairing should be, but so often isn’t. I have not had a single instance of my audio cutting out.
Directions aren’t the best - as you can see even from the description and details provided by the vendor here on the product page, they could stand a little more work on their translation capabilities.
Back to the sound. I’ve given them 4 stars. Do they compare with my personal wired earbuds, or with my wired or wireless headphones? Well, no. But then, would I really expect these very inexpensive earbuds to be able to compete with something costing 5 to 10 times more? For the price, the sound is pretty damn good. Plus, I can use these in the shower with no issues whatsoever. I can’t say that about any of my other earbuds or headphones.

21,Even better than I expected.,"The Boloxa Wireless Sports headphones arrived just a few days after I placed the order. The box it came in was well packaged, and it had a complete user manuel with all the information, warnings and instructions, and the entire thing was in English. Some product inserts have very little information, and they are in so many different languages, there isn't space to say much in English, so I really appreciated having an entire printed booklet come with the headphones. After reading the instructions and taking them out of the box, I turned them on and they paired immediately with my iPhone. I tested the volume of both speakers, and I could only turn it up about halfway as the sound is so good and clear that any higher would have been too loud.
The appearance is very sleek, and though I have never owned earbuds/headphones that wrapped around the ear, I was delighted by how comfortable they were to use, despite having a number of ear piercings (see photo). I went about my day, enjoying listening to music and videos while I did laundry and washed dishes. Despite being used for several consecutive hours, the battery remained mostly full. When I placed them back in the case, they were charged to full again in less than an hour. Awesome! When I ordered these headphones, I didn't expect to love them as much as I do, which is somewhat unfortunate for me, as I have already promised them to my 21 year old son. Ah well, I guess I can always order another set for myself, and at the current price of $29.99 I feel they are very good value for money. I have already owned a set of earbuds from this company for some time (they look like airpods), so I know they make good, quality products that last.

I knew based on how much money I was spending on these, that they weren't gonna be top quality or anything. So I'm not gonna go and say that these are garbage or anything like that, I'll just give my experience with them. I do like that they come with many sizes of cushion pieces to put in your ear, especially because my right ear needs a different size than my left. The battery life is pretty decent, but could be better. I'd say the headphones themselves last around 4-5 hours. The case's battery life is meh, not as great.

I just unboxed these a half hour ago and was very excited for them. I have trouble keeping normal earbuds in my ears, let alone wireless ones but I was pleasantly surprised that they came with a piece small enough and it fits comfortably. (I also have tics in which I shake my head a lot, and they stayed in!!)
Sound quality is good from what I can tell, and it seems to cancel a lot of noise from around me.
The one thing that is bothering me is the infidelity of the connection. I will be listening to music for a minute and it'll be fantastic; smooth, clear, balanced... and then it starts to cut in and out for indefinite amounts of time.
I haven't seen anything about the connection once they are paired, so maybe I just got a defective pair? I will have to play around with them more and I'll update if anything changes.
Update:: I've had them for a few hours now and have messed around with them to find that the bluetooth connectivity issue was my phone (I have an old Galaxy Prime J7 whatever the heck you call it and it constantly gives me trouble with everything I do). I have them connected to my computer (playing the same music as before) right now and can hear it clearly and listen to it when I am two floors apart from my computer.

381,Bluetooth Earphones,"I’ve been staying away from bluetooth earphones because they didn’t last long. Supposedly, the battery on this one is supposed to last at least 70 hours. Ok, so I decided to try it when 2 of my plugin earphones broke within about a month of each other.
First, it arrived already charged so you can use it, although I wasn’t sure how long the charge was, so I charged it a little longer.
Easy to set up with any bluetooth electronics. It’s nice and portable, not like the bigger ones I’ve seen around. Folds up for compact travel and lightweight. The charger is USB-C.
It does come with an audio line just in case, which is ideal and I like that you have that option.
As for sound, it sounds like any other earphone I have had, but I did hear the bass sounds a little more prominent in the music I was listening to.
All of the controls are on the right side of the earphones. Inside the phones is an “L” or “R” to let you know which side is which. It does take a moment to figure out how all of the buttons work, as some of them have more than one function. For example, the volume buttons are also the forward buttons, depending how long you hold them down.
The equalizer is very elementary sounding. The vocal mode just sounded like more treble. Pop mode sounded more blended and I really couldn’t tell the difference in the bass mode. Maybe someone with a better musical ear can explain if there are differences.
It doesn’t matter to me. I just wanted a pair of earphones so I can go around my place and not worry about a line, but also not worry about the bluetooth dying quickly. It is pretty comfortable to wear, but I was concerned that it is smaller than my other ones. The size wasn’t a problem for me.
I didn’t realize it, but according to the description, there is a microphone attached so you can use the earphones for your phone. I haven’t tried it yet because I really don’t see myself using it, but I’m glad it’s there just in case.
The range is pretty good. I passed through a building 35 feet long, and forgot to take the phones off. I could still hear whatever I was listening to, without any interruptions, which was pretty cool.

221,Good for people who easily lose stuff because they are cheap and you won't feel so bad.,"Verified Purchase
Bought these twice, first set was for a friend. Says they sound great, just like their previous set which were skull candy but they lost one. Batteries lasts longer than the skull candy wireless buds, and their case didn't need charging for a week.
The first set came as usb c.
Second set arrived today. Was not usb c. Slightly disappointed because not only does the description have a picture of a usb c tip, it also claims the case is a type c. Disappointing in that the first pair was usb c and my friend has an iPhone so didn't really care. I on the other hand have a phone with a usb c connection so it would've been ideal. Whatever, they sound pretty good.
In my household between my husband and I, we have 3 sets of bose over the ear bluetooth headphones. Two of which are noise cancelling, the new silver ones and the last gen black ones. He also has the sound sport free, wireless in ear bose buds.

Verified Purchase Bought these twice, first set was for a friend. Says they sound great, just like their previous set which were skull candy but they lost one. Batteries lasts longer than the skull candy wireless buds, and their case didn't need charging for a week. The first set came as usb c. Second set arrived today. Was not usb c. Slightly disappointed because not only does the description have a picture of a usb c tip, it also claims the case is a type c. Disappointing in that the first pair was usb c and my friend has an iPhone so didn't really care. I on the other hand have a phone with a usb c connection so it would've been ideal. Whatever, they sound pretty good. In my household between my husband and I, we have 3 sets of bose over the ear bluetooth headphones. Two of which are noise cancelling, the new silver ones and the last gen black ones. He also has the sound sport free, wireless in ear bose buds.

I was afraid to buy another set of earbuds from Amazon because I recently purchased a popular brand of earbuds from Amazon, and they came to me damaged, unable to charge, and these were very, very pricey earbuds.
Fast forward a bit after my refund and I decided to look for water resistant earbuds as well as noise cancelling. These were the first ones to come up, and for the price, I had to check the reviews, read the stats, and check on the battery life.
It is day one of having these earbuds and so far, so good. Great sound -As a musician the sound is very important and so far it drowns out my fan, but also sounds like high quality as if you were at the concert of the artists. Great job overall. I don't know about water resistant yet or anything else, but the sound and battery plus the sleek design of the case and the box it came in make me give this 5 stars for sure.

19,Convenient wireless charging,"These headphones have great sound quality for the price. Do not expect audiophile level sounds, but for the average user these headphones sound great! They fit snugly in the ear and even include different ear tips in case you need a different size. The sports wing tips that go around your ear make these super convenient for exercising since you know the headphones will not pop out of your ear like some other headphone brands that only barely stick in your ear. I was looking for a solution since my previous pair of Bluetooth headphones would fall off when I’m working around the house and I didn’t want to have to deal with something around the neck that feels heavy or gets in the way.
I also appreciate the buttons on both headphones that allow some more intricate controls (you can go to the previous track using your left ear instead of having to press at least 3 times – which with my previous headphones I feel like never registers correctly.) Additionally, it’s nice since you can pair each headphone separately if needed in mono mode and still control it with a button on either. I like to do this when working around the house or at a coffee shop so I can hear family or friends if they are calling for me.
Lastly, the headphones case is a great upgrade for me. I love the display that shows how much battery you actually have left instead of having to guess or just always plugging it in – it also shows you if the headphones are charging or not which is convenient. Lastly, the best part is that the case can wirelessly charge now!

377,better than my Sony headphones,"I bought these headphones for my daughter, who would listen to music 24/7 if she could.
After charging (her device said they were only 90% charged, despite being fully charged according to the instructions and light on the headphones), we connected them to her Samsung tablet. Very easy to connect through bluetooth. I say this after multiple headaches with my own Sony bluetooth headphones.
The aux cord is great, so she can listen to music through her Echo Dot. I knew going in that these would not connect wirelessly to her Echo Dot, but, with the cord, they're perfect. She just has to sit and listen, which is fine when she's drawing and painting.
I wanted to make sure the sound quality was good. I only partially trusted the reviews I read prior to purchase. The sound quality is AMAZING. I feel like she got a better pair of headphones than I did, and I own some $200-something Sony headphones.
The volume buttons on her headphones literally control the volume on the device, unlike some volume control buttons when you're connected through bluetooth. We watched the Samsung dial go up and down as we pressed the buttons. (We're easily amused.) The headphones also have a play/pause button and an EQ button.

38,They stay where they are supposed to in your ear!,"I may have odd shaped ears because up until I received the A17 model, I've never been able to wear earbuds and have them stay in place in my ear. Especially when I exercise, which is primarily when I wear the earbuds. In addition to not moving in my ear, the next thing I noticed was the sound quality. Very impressive! I'm not an expert but we all know when something sounds either good or off just a bit. These sound good at both ends of the scale. I used to travel every week for years and at the time I purchased a pair of very expensive noise cancelling over the ears head phones. They worked wonderfully for years, until one day they just quit working. I can't say the A17's work as well as the over the ear model I wore on an airplane (because I have no plans to be on an airplane) but they seem to work as well in the gym where there is always background noise.
Overall I'm very impressed with the quality, both sound and fit, and would highly recommend the A17 Headphones. Especially for the price! They are comparable to my old over the ear model that cost over ten times as much!

136,Excellent earbuds!!!!!!,"Verified Purchase
I loved these earbuds for months, and still do! Excellent sound quality, easy connection, just wonderful! I loved them so much I bought my boyfriend a pair immediately, and boy have they been helpful as we both worked from home during the pandemic! The charging case is brilliant, and I love how they turn on/off automatically when you take them out or put them in the case. I bought them for running, and they were excellent! I wear them frequently with a mask and they don’t feel uncomfortable at all, nor do they fall out when taking on/off the mask.
My reason for 3 stars though..... the battery life was previously amazing, I felt like I could use these for so long and they wouldn’t die! The charging case was awesome too as I stated above. However, after using them for about 2 months, the charging case stopped charging them. Sometimes I’d plug them into the PLUGGED IN fully charged case, and they still wouldn’t charge. I’d find out randomly that my earbuds were on (and using charge) in the case, therefore making my phone only play sound through Bluetooth. This is when I manually turned them off before plugging them in as well. Just super annoying, and definitely not something I should have to replace two months later. I contacted the company and after several messages that were difficult to understand, they agreed to send me replacements. If I receive a replacement and the charging issue was a one time thing, I will definitely edit my review!
*****Edit 8/8/20.... I received my replacements in two days! They are EXCELLENT and I was pleased to see they now take a USB-C charger! This means basically nothing to me but my techie boyfriend says it’s a major upgrade :face_with_tears_of_joy: I see no issues with the charging case at all in this new pair so I think my other pair was just a fluke!

200,This bud's for you!,"Verified Purchase
These are the best BT earbuds yet for my iPhone. They give true, excellent, binaural sound, and turn on and connect immediately as soon as you take one or both out of their charging case. You can use one or both, take them into the shower, switch ears with the same earbud--the R and L, while marked, seem to be angled the same.
Pairing was seamless--I just turned on BT in iPhone--no buttons to push. There are 3 sizes of ear cushions, and the fit (in my ears, anyway) is good, and they are comfortable.
I've been through far too many ""waterproof"" earbuds, what with poor battery times, need for USB plug-in charge, no charging case, mediocre sound quality. These are by far the best.
Interesting question as to whether they are better than the Apple AirPods (Plus), price not withstanding. There's no noise cancellation option, unless I've missed it. They work fine w Siri. There's no magnetic charging option, but with the long battery life of the charging case, it's hardly necessary. The charging case is a bit bigger than that of the AirPods.
Bottom line--for about 1/6 of the now widely available discounted price of the AirPods Plus, I would seriously consider these as my primary earbuds if you don't need the adjustable noise cancellation feature, magnetic charging, and some of the other iPhone-specific features of the AirPods.",Kenneth A.

142,"Good bass, solid build quality, nice assortment of accessories","Verified Purchase
I got these as a pair of headphones to use in the gym and as general around-town beaters. Shipping was overnight (hooray Amazon Prime!). The packaging felt very solid, everything was secure and in great shape. A charging/storage case was provided, along with a carrying strap. Additionally, a nice array of high-quality tips were provided, making it easy to find a size/shape that fit my ears. The case is high quality with a nice weight, lid closure is magnetic and the earbuds slide easily into place and are secured by magents. A charging cable is provided (although you have to provide your own wall-adapter if desired). Documentation/instructions are present and clear although some of the syntax/English is not perfect.
Initial impression of the build quality is high - the earbuds feel solid, yet light. They each have a single button on them that has a variety of context-aware functions, although it is a bit off that you have to use one headphone to go to the next track and the other to go backwards.
First thing I noticed while listening to them is how bass-forward they are. They provided a surprisingly defined and present low-end that I did not expect from their size and price-point. This does come at the cost of mid-range definition (I found the mids to be somewhat suppressed / muddied) and some high-end harshness.
Overall some of the things that I liked: the price, the amount/quality of the low end, variety of accessories, pairing was easy, earbuds turn on/off when taken out/put into the charging case.
Some of the things I didn't like: Physical buttons (compared to touch-interfaces present on other higher-end headphones like Galaxy Buds) meant that to change tracks I was jamming the earbuds into my ears, the oddly loud voice instructions / notifications that are built in.
These earbuds surprised me at their price of ~$30. I think that they are a great product for people looking for water-resistant earbuds for the gym that will pump out some good motivational soundtracks.

My son needed some headphones so he can use them at school while he is doing his school work (Teachers allow the use of headphones while doing classwork). He wanted something that was noise cancelling because sometimes the kids in his class get a little too loud.

I didn't even realize there was a microphone until I came to leave the review and saw it in the title. I checked and saw the microphone spot. So I will try that later when I have time to make a discord call and ask friends about any delay and sound quality.,train

128,Best wireless buds I've owned so far...,"Verified Purchase
I was looking for something that didn't look like I had a growth protruding from my ear and had decent sound quality with a bit of noise cancellation and these fit the bill.
The charging situation with these is great. The lanyard allows me to simply connect the charging container to the zipper of my work bag and lets it hang in my bag. Very sturdy charging container. I have zero concerns about it hanging in my back and taking the constant movement. I keep a charging block in my back that I simply connect via USB and charge them like a phone. No need to even move the thing from my bag.
The buds themselves are well constructed and easy to use once you get used to the operation.
Connectivity works great with my Android phone and I haven't had a single problem with them in any way.
Very solid. Sound great. I would certainly buy these again.
I use them mainly for driving to work and back. Sometimes I use them with my Windows 10 desktop but they have the ordinary bluetooth range so I can't really walk around the house with them because the walls will interfere with the signal... but that's an inherent bluetooth limitation.
Battery life is pretty good for my use. I drive about 15-20 minutes one way and I don't need to charge them but maybe once a week. I turn them off when I get to work and when I get home.
They fit snug and do not irritate my typically sensitive ears. Some earbuds, wireless or not, tend to make my inner-ear area sensitive and sore... and these do not do that.
I would recommend these to anyone looking for a decent pair of BT wireless earbuds. In fact I might look for this brand when I search for other audio products. I've never heard of Beben before but I'd buy other products from them if I happen across anything they make when shopping for other items.

172,Does what it promises and afforable,"Verified Purchase
These earbuds have a lot of features and seem to be of great quality, so at its price point it is a steal.
The Good:
- Affordable compared to other wireless earbud competitors
- I'm no audiophile, but the sound quality is perfectly satisfactory for me
- Raised multi-purpose button on each earbud, allowing a combination of presses for all sorts of instructions (volume control, song selection, power, play/pause, phone calling, etc).
- Range is as advertised. Tested at around 15 feet with no real disruption.
- The charge case is a great inclusion
- Includes 3 different sizes of earbud caps to suit your comfort
- Bluetooth pairing was painless
- Design looks fine
The bad:
- It doesn't ""feel"" as secure as I would like it to, but in reality it does stayin my ears just fine with movement. I find that the best way to put it in is to twist it into my ear canal, as opposed to trying to push straight in (the pressure wall won't allow it). I think I'll just get used to this.
- The volume controls are slowwww. You have to continue to hold either the left/right earbud button down for a second until it begins to raise/lower the volume slowly in increments, and then you let go when acceptable. You can imagine this is frustratingly longer than having an option that raises/lowers volume with discrete button presses.
- When you perform an action with the earbud buttons, there is a voice that announces your action. WHAT??? So everytime I skip to the next song or go back, I hear this stupid ""FORWARD"" or ""REVERSE"". It is absolutely ridiculous and the fact there isn't an option to disable this is even worse. What kind of respectable music player would do this?

13,"Very comfortable, all-purpose earbuds","I have been enjoying my new earbuds doing all kinds of activities for the past couple of weeks and I am truly impressed. These little guys not only meet but exceed my expectations in every aspect, making them a worthy investment for anyone looking for an inexpensive all-purpose pair of earbuds.
First, the sound quality of these earbuds is simply remarkable. Compared to my previous favorite headphones, these have a little extra goodness for my listening enjoyment. The bass is deep and resonant, while the treble is crisp and clear. Whether I’m listening to my favorite songs/podcasts, watching movies, or even taking phone calls, the audio quality is consistently impressive. The awesome L-to-R stereo sounds brings me back to the first time I heard AC/DC and Styx on my Sony Walkman.
Comfort is an important factor for me, and I'm pleased that these earbuds excel in this department. They come with two tip sizes, ensuring a snug fit. I use them as they came out of the box and have not experienced any discomfort. The lightweight design and sleek shape make them easy to wear while relaxing at home, working out, or running - without worrying I might drop one. They are also sweat and water-resistant.
They effortlessly work well with all my Bluetooth devices and the connection remains stable even from 10+ feet away, like when I run out to check the mail. The touch controls make it easy to adjust the volume, skip tracks or answer calls without reaching for my phone. And I really like the automatic reconnection when I take them out of the case.
Battery life is another area where these earbuds excel. With a single charge, I am able to enjoy hours of use. The charging case shows the % of life, fits well in my small purse and provides additional power when I can’t plug in.
With exceptional sound quality, comfort, connectivity, battery life, and low price, these definitely surpassed my expectations.

The quality of these headphones are great depending on what your plan is for their use. The sound quality was stellar and they fit in the ears nicely. I purchased them to wear to bed to help me fall asleep. They paired great with my phone and I though they are a little large for a side sleeper, I felt these were going to be much better than the corded ear buds I had. I charged them up so they would be ready. The first night, they were great! The battery lasted all night. I didn't recharge them before going to bed the second night because they had been in their case all day and the case itself had a charge so I thought I was fine. The second night, I was woken up by them saying LOUDLY (much louder than I had the volume set for) in my ear ""BATTERY LOW"", then a few minutes later ""POWERING OFF"". Well, that was a rude awakening so I thought my solution was to charge them up before going to bed. The next night, same thing.. but worse. Each ear bud yelled in my ear on separate timelines. First the right ear, battery low! Powering off! Took that one out and put in the case. The left one was still playing music so I felt I was fine. NOPE! About 10 minutes later, BATTERY LOW, POWERING OFF! Not sure why I didn't just remove them both after the first time they yelled at me. Hubby was still snoring so I was hoping they would just shut off instead of announcing their departure? Who knows. Anyway, boxed them up for a return the next morning.

120,CHANGED PRODUCT,"Verified Purchase
**EDIT: this listing has completely changed from what it was when I bought it. The original headphones were not airpod ripoffs, they were a genuine great product that I was paid to review, just for them to change the product to rip off apple and you.**
**I received this product for free. This offer is no longer available for amazon customers. **
I have been using airpods for about a year now and love the convenience that they bring. However, my ear shape allows them to fall out when working out, which can be a real problem. In come these headphones.
Pros:
Great sound quality. Definitely better than the airpods as expected since these are in-ear headphones.
Great array of included tips for headphones.
Good battery life with LED's on each bud to show if they are on (these only flash when charging/pairing)
Case battery has 5 LED's to show current charge status. This is a nice welcome feature, as it allows me to quickly see how much charge I have at the beginning of the day rather than having to keep a pod in the case and open my phone to see the battery life, which is the case for the airpods. The airpods will give me a ""almost dead"" orange light but that's not as descriptive as these ones.
Noise cancellation is pretty good thanks to the custom fitting of the tips.
PRICE! These things are easily worth the 30 dollars. If I had to guess, I would've put these at a 70-80 price range.
Cons:
cheap and short included USB micro cable. I would have liked to see USB type C.
Case is a little large. I like to keep my airpods in my pocket, but the profile of the case is too big to make it comfortable for keeping in my jeans' pocket. There is an included strap, but I never have been a fan of these solutions.
I seriously recommend these. For the price, I was concerned they would be cheap, but I would have rather had these than spend the money on the airpods. My biggest fear was the lack of convenience that these would bring compared to the apple solution. However, outside of the standard bluetooth pairing, the experience is the same. Apple allows you to just open the case and they connect- these require you to initially set them up through settings. However, once that is done, taking one or both out of the case will instantly sync them up. You can take just one out of the case and use it, which is what I do, and the other will continue charging.

I have always had a problem with earbud type headphones. They either fall out easily or do not usually feel comfortable. As a result I have always used over the ear headphones. During Prime Days I came across some earbud type blue tooth headphones at a great price and decided to give them a try. I really liked them. They fit well and were more comfortable than the over the ear set I have when listening for a long period of time. I still had a concern about them coming out if I were moving about, so I decided to try these wrap around headphones. I absolutely love them! They are very comfortable and give the added security that I wanted. They stay in place no matter what activity I do.

I read the description of these headphones and didn't believe the battery life they advertised, mainly because I wear my headphones in Bluetooth mode between 18-20 hrs a day. I figured that I probably use headphones more rigorously than the average user but even with a fraction of the advertised battery life, I'd still be happy.
I bought them in late 2021 (November-ish) and it's now late February and they have completely performed as advertised. I legitimately only have to charge these things 1x week (some times less frequently)! And they really do charge really quickly!
I'm not a sound expert but I take phone calls on them all the time and haven't had any kind of problem with them for that (I have had that with other BT headphones before), I use them for everything from watching YouTube, listening to music & listening to Podcasts to taking online work meetings across multiple apps. I rarely need to but I've had it connected to both my phone and laptop at the same time as well. I've only used the ""EQ"" setting a couple of times but it took the song I was listening to from just regular & audible to feeling like I was surrounded with the music. It works well with audio that is made to sound like it's coming from different angles, too. I've even been watching something on my phone and heard a sound that I never noticed before but forgot I was wearing headphones and thought the sound was coming from the room I was in.

I have been using these for a little over a week and I must say that I really like them for the overall sound quality. My job does not allow me to move around a lot so for me the buds stay in perfect place for the day. I did notice that when I run however they feel a bit top heavy and have a tendency to work themselves out of my ear. The case is nice and solid and so are the buds. To me they do not feel cheap even though the price is low. The battery last longer than I thought they would and I only change about every three days and use them about 9 hours a day. Not sure how long that is going to last but I will go the long haul.
The audio quality is better than I expected, noise cancellation is passive however I did find that the jumps in volume are a little more steep than I expected. You have to mess with the up and down volume control to get it dialed in perfect. If the company made a app that allowed for some fine tune adjustments like volume steps and EQ that would be a great plus.
Overall sound is good with little outside interference. With lower volume you can hear cars and some wind noise while out side but one bump up it's completely gone.
The case that charges the buds is good and it does charge fast. Led indicators display battery level and they fit secure for changing. These are awesome buds for the price.

I eager to help you find a good quality item. I came in to buy these with pretty low expectations considering the price range. But I have been very impressed with the quality of them.
These full wireless earbuds have great functionality. The buttons are very intuitive and will automatically connected and disconnect from my device and I open and close the carrying case. The buttons are responsive and work very well. The noise is not incredible, but come on, at this price range you can't expect great noise quality. These are light weight and I have found they fit great in my ears. Don't worry if you have huge ear canals are very small ones, as they come with more sizes then I have ever seen come with ear buds, from giant to tiny. I have not tested them in water, though I am sure they will meet the criteria described in the item summary.
The case is one of my favorite features. It has a really nice feel and does not attract finger prints. It comes with a lanyard which I thought was a very nice touch. This case has lights that show the power level, making it easy to know when they need the be charged again. And, what I think might be the best feature for this case, the type c charging.
My one critique would be that the buttons take quite a bit of pressure the press. This is very nitpicky though, as it is not terrible, just a little inconvenient.",Stephen L.

8,Excellent Value,"I’ve been very impressed with this product so far.
The earbuds rest comfortably on my ears. Normally, I find that the plastic that encompasses my ears causes some soreness. So far, I have not encountered this issue. I like that these are relatively comfortable and unlike the large headphones that encapsulate your ears, these won’t make my ears all sweaty.
The volume setting is as expected and is on par with other headphones that I have used in the past. The clarity of my music is nice and I don’t notice any kind of feedback, fuzziness, or scratchiness. I think it could be a bit louder, but probably not good for my hearing long term.
The headset comes with a small charging station / dock in which you can place your earbuds when you are finished using them. Since we are dealing with electronics, I make sure the little metal pins used to charge each earbud are dry and free of debris. The case itself is a hard case, making it resistant to drop, bumps, or other mishaps.
Pairing the headset is relatively quick and the instructions were very clear.
There are two ways to turn off the headset: either by docking each earbud or by holding the buttons on each headset. One thing I figured out is that they won’t power off via the button press while music is playing, so one will need to turn that off first in order to power down the unit. The headset will automatically turn on when removed from the docking station. I don’t see this as a downside because if I am taking them out, I plan on using them.
While charging you can see how much battery life is left on the headset when you dock the earbuds. I find this pretty useful so that I don’t overcharge my electronics. Each charge seems to last between 6 to 12 hours at full volume. This may change if one is on the phone the entire time.
While using the headset to speak or communicate, the person I am speaking with is able to hear me clearly. I don’t have to worry about positioning a microphone, which is nice.

I use this product to listen to music, podcast, and audio books. I absolutely love these earbuds. I love that I can take a shower while wearing my earbuds I love that I don't have to worry about if they get wet in the rain walking to and from my car. The ability to use one earbud or two is great for me. The battery life for the Bebens are quite impressive My fiance has a pair of earbuds from a DIFFERENT brand (which is what made me want a pair of wireless earbuds) and his are nice and three times the price of mine but his battery life sucks he can't work a whole 10-12hour shift without his going dead. He can't shower with his and he has to use both earbuds or the right sided earbud which may not seem like a big deal but it's a huge plus to just grab one and go and do crafts with the kids and not worry if I got the right one. His earbuds also have a very short range In distance. He pretty much has to keep his phone on him or what he is listening to will come and go in the earbud.
I'm buying him a pair of Bebens just to have for work because the battery life. Like I said before the ones he has now are way more costly but can't do the same things as mine and I have used his earbuds before mine arrived and there is no difference in sound. I actually prefer my earbuds over his, the Bebens are more comfortable , stay in place better, has a longer distance in range so I can leave my phone on the deck and wash my car and not lose sound.
I also haven't had one problem with talking on the phone while using my earbuds both parties can hear great. The only thing I wish Bebens had where color options. Other then that I'm very pleased with my earbuds and will be a company I follow and if I ever need new earbuds this company will be my first stop. I have learned two things.

182,Great item. Super quality sound and battery life.,"Verified Purchase
Love it! I have several True wireless earbuds in the house including some major name brand that costs couple of hundred bucks but so far this one is my go to pair. My biggest issue I've had in the past with these type earbuds are that they don't stay in the ear for long during an extreme workout. They seem to move around a bit once I sweat during a dynamic workout and would have to keep adjusting them. I can say that this one is different as it fits like a glove and you won't notice them on after couple of minutes you put them on as they're comfortable. The sound is great and volume can go pretty high without sounding horrible. I like that it can be worn on either side. I mean the one that says L fits just the same on R and vise versa. This is perfect for me since I can switch them because I prefer to wear only one while running on the roads on my left ear more than the right. The feature I like is audible notification on these. Comes with 6 sets of earplugs so you can be assure one of them will gives you a right fit. Battery life is impressive. I've had this for about 5 hours non stop on music and about 8 hours on standby mode and so far and haven't had to put back in case to recharge yet.
I prefer the click button type as I don't have to worry about accidental clicks with touch type. Friends say I sound clear when I'm on the phone with them so it's a plus.

I've had this for about 5 hours non stop on music and about 8 hours on standby mode and so far and haven't had to put back in case to recharge yet. I prefer the click button type as I don't have to worry about accidental clicks with touch type. Friends say I sound clear when I'm on the phone with them so it's a plus. Try them on. You'll like it.,train
204,Wow! Better Than Others I've Tried,"Verified Purchase
This is my third pair of headphones that are similar to these. All I can say is WOW! I only got them this afternoon but I've been using them. The sound quality is better than others I have tried, specifically the bass. For the price you can't go wrong on these, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another pair. As far as battery life goes, I typically don't listen for too terribly long before I'm done. But I've listened for almost 2 hours and they were still going when I put them back in the case. They fit in the ear well with the correct adjustments. They have buttons on the side to stop, play, skip forward/back, answer calls, etc. However the left one does something different than the right...just a bit strange to get use to but I'm sure it will be second nature when I start using them more.
Instructions say they will work swimming/shower/rain. I'd be a bit nervous to use them for personal reasons while swimming...would hate for them to get ruined. They say not to use them diving but I'd assume if you put your head under water you'd be ok. I hope they last a long time and if not they are backed by a decent warranty for a set of headphones. As long as the company follows through with any issues that might creep up I am happy. Overall great quality and a sweet charging case..it even vibrates when you plug it in.

I’ve been using my wireless earbuds for the past couple of days and love them!
Comfort/Fit: The earbuds are very cozy and sometimes I forget they are in. It took a couple of times testing out the different sizes of earbud caps to find the perfect fit. They provide you with many different cap sizes which is great.
Bluetooth Distance: The distance you can travel away from your phone is great. I don’t have an exact measurement but I’ve tried them out with chores around the house and they were able to remain connected to my phone, even if I left it downstairs and was cleaning the upstairs. I would estimate their range from my phone is more like 20-30 feet, possibly a little further.
Sound Quality/Noise Cancelling: I think the sound quality is great. The noise-canceling is almost too good. If I have my volume on low, it seems to cancel out most of the noise and I usually need to pause the sound or take one earbud out to hear the person.
Battery life: I charged the battery on the day I received it and it had lasted me for the past 3 days. I’ve probably used it for about 4-5 hours total and the charging case is only down to 2/4 bars.
Setup ease: I had some difficulty where only one earbud connected originally. This was not a big problem because they provide step by step instructions in case this happens. It was easy to resolve and I was all set up in about 5 minutes with no further connectivity issues.
Additional Thoughts: I wanted to test these out during a workout and found that they stayed in my ears.

32,Wireless Earbuds for Fitness Enthusiasts!,"If you're a fitness enthusiast like me, searching for the perfect earbuds for your workout sessions, look no further! These wireless earbuds have been a game-changer for me, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
Firstly, the waterproof feature is a game-changer for gym-goers who tend to sweat profusely during workouts. I used to worry about sweat ruining my earbuds, but these earbuds are built to withstand the toughest workouts and intense perspiration. Sweat all you want, and they'll stay perfectly functional, no matter how intense your exercise routine is!
The Hi-Fi sound quality is simply outstanding. Every beat and note come through crystal clear, enhancing my workout experience to a whole new level. The immersive audio motivates and energizes me, making those intense training sessions feel effortless.
One feature I genuinely adore is the button control. As someone who works out in gloves, I've struggled with touch controls on other earbuds. But with these, I can easily manage my music, calls, and even access voice assistants without any hassle. It's perfect for quick adjustments during my workouts, allowing me to stay focused and in the zone.
Overall, these wireless earbuds have exceeded my expectations in every aspect. They are an excellent choice for gym enthusiasts who demand durability, exceptional sound, and user-friendly controls.

7,Clear voice quality and great fit - No fall,"They come with different-sized ear tips to ensure a secure and comfortable fit for various ear shapes and sizes. The lightweight construction, combined with the ergonomic design, ensures that the earbuds stay in place during workouts, daily commutes, or extended listening sessions. You can wear them for hours without experiencing any discomfort or fatigue. I recommend getting another pair for my family.
One of the standout features of the Boloxa A17 is its wide and balanced frequency response. Whether you're a fan of bass-heavy beats or prefer the crisp clarity of high notes, these headphones deliver exceptional audio performance across the entire sound spectrum. The sound quality is rich, immersive, and highly satisfying, making it an absolute joy to listen to music, podcasts, or any other audio content.
Connection is easy and reliable. Unlike a few others, these don’t randomly disconnect or go to “Pause”. It also offers a very decent range – I can easily walk from one floor to another floor down the hallway to the other side and very rarely do I lose connection.
the Boloxa A17 earbuds provide approximately 5 hours of playback time on a single charge. The included charging case extends the usage time by providing multiple additional charges on the go. Pairing the earbuds with your Bluetooth-enabled devices is a breeze, and the connection remains stable within a reasonable range, ensuring uninterrupted music playback and hands-free calling.
There are two ways to turn off the headset: either by docking each earbud or by holding the buttons on each headset. One thing I figured out is that they won’t power off via the button press while music is playing, so one will need to turn that off first in order to power down the unit. The headset will automatically turn on when removed from the docking station. I don’t see this as a downside because if I am taking them out, I plan on using them.
The only improvement I wish for is a slight tweak in design so that both earbuds can allow volume up and down instead of the left earbud for volume down and the right for volume up. Also, it would be good battery/charging display is on the outside of the case.

I go to college in Boston, and my campus is about half a mile from where I live so I walk to and from every day and sometimes on weekends for studying. Same for my job; it's right around the corner. Earbuds with wires tend to be too much clutter and tangle easily, so I purchased those primarily for that purpose. And then COVID-19 hit, so now I'm wearing a mask all the time. Wires become even more of a nuisance.
The positive reviews were hyping up the bass of these earbuds, as well as noise cancelling, etc. and I truthfully wasn't expecting any of that to be super good considering the price. I just needed them to walk around the city without wires. But wow!! As soon as I put them in, even without putting music on yet, they were SO noise cancelling. I have a toddler living in my household, and he's in his terrible twos, so I'm constantly hearing screaming. I heard almost nothing!! When I put music on, at 50% volume I could comfortably hear the music with minimal background noise. I also listen to several genres of music (classical, opera, pop, R&B, rock, alternative, some country, etc.), so I tested them out for each. Bass was perfect where there was some, all songs were clear and crisp, and nothing was muffled. Because of this, I also started using them while exercising. I have a running, weight lifting, and yoga regimen and they don't fall out at all. The music is still clear. But like any earbud, your ears get sore a little bit after a while.

76,Great value! Easy to control,"I received my BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones a few days ago and I’ve had the chance to use them in several different situations. Sitting in my office, they are great for work calls - clear sound and easy to control - volume up, volume down, next/previous track, answer, etc. Walking my dog, same story - easy to adjust volumes and mute/unmute. No issues with fit or keeping them in place. This is a particularly good feature when doing anything that involves a little more movement - other buds I have tried tended to move or fall out when I was jogging or working out - these stay in place.

144,Solid bang for buck!,"Verified Purchase
First, let's look at the price. In a world of ""you get what you pay for,"" these ignore that completely. These could easily sell for a bit more. I bought these on impulse and am not reviewing from an ""audiophile"" standpoint, but from the ""I want music when I hit the treadmill, walk my dog, or go skiing"" standpoint. So far, so good.
I've had these headphones for 3 full days and have put them through some paces. Podcasts, phone calls, music - while exercising, walking my dog, or driving (one ear for phone calls). The earbuds came with a number of different sizes of adapters; I have abnormally large ear canals and they fit awesomely. I can't wear Apple Airpods or the headphones that come with Apple devices as they fall right out.
I have three tiny complaints that I would consider more ""imperfections"" than I would problems:
1. The seal is SO GOOD when they're connected, that even when the music is paused, I can hardly hear my surroundings. I need to take one out to talk to people or to be aware of traffic when I'm out on the street.
2. Despite that seal being great, the ""angle"" of the earbud is tough to determine when they're in my ears. That said, once I get them in, they don't really move.
3. I didn't read the directions, so it's my fault in part that I went to use them and one of the earbuds died on me. Turns out that when I put them in the charging case, I need to pop the button on each of them to charge. Lesson learned, for sure, but it's one of those things that, to me, should just be that it charges when you put it in the case.
Sound quality isn't bad! I was nervous when the ""pairing"" dialogue wasn't in time, but the music and spoken word worked marvelously. I listened to songs that had heavy panning and each ear delivered sound in a percieveably well-balanced manner. The standard EQ isn't too bass-heavy.

29,Very Pleasantly Surprised,"Been trying out many, many different sports-oriented wireless earbuds over the past two years (occiam, apekx, okeefe, Tozo, etc., you name it). Over numerous disappointments and many frustrating experiences, took a flyer on this relatively new product and I’m very glad I did. Across all the ones I’ve tried in this price range, this one by far is the best. A few highlights below:
1) Sound quality is up there even against mainstream brand products that that boast noise-canceling features such as Beats and Skull Candy (by the way, way overrated). Music is crisp, podcasts are clear and it responds quite well when I was toying around with equalizer apps on my phone. No issues with phone calls even in crowded public spaces.
2) Connection is easy and reliable. Unlike my experience with Tozo and a few others, these don’t randomly disconnects or goes to “Pause”. It also offers a very decent range – I can easily walk from my desk down the hallway to the other side and very rarely do I lose connection.
3) Battery life is quite amazing. Instead of having to charge every other night before going to bed, these can easily last me almost and entire week just using the case to charge during showers and meetings. I pretty much wear them all the time – during my commute, at work, in gyms, out running errands, etc.
4) The earpieces are very comfortable to wear all day, and unlike a few others do not fall off. I also very much appreciate the big, round buttons controls on the side. They are easy to reach / find, do not require much effort to press, and most importantly not based on touch sensors where I can accidentally drop a call or stop a track when I’m just making slight adjustments or taking one side off.
5) This is one of the very few models that come with wireless charging, and it works quite well. No need to frequently adjust the positioning to make it work.
The only improvement I wish for is a slight tweak in design so the battery / charging display is on the outside of the case. Other than that, I’m extremely satisfied and do plan on gifting this true gem to friends and family this Christmas season.

They have a very smooth response range, and they have mode button that will allow you to make subtle changes jin the response curve in accordance with your personal liking,. They have a full sound with full bassl, and if you should desire more base simply hit the mode button for a boost.
I listened to a few of my favorites. Some Berlioz, 'Willy', and Bon Jovi.
From that test I am well satisfied that these headphones could put sound in my ears all day without causing listening fatigue, or discomfort from wearing them for long hours at a time.
They are as the details say, lightweight and comfortable. They conform to your ears.
The fold away feature is really nice for travel or storage.
Again, well designed and very simple functionality.
These are described as headphones and that is their primary purpose but if you need to take a call or instigate a call they do have a microphone function. Not great sounding, not suitable for a podcast but plenty good for phone calls. That is an added bonus to the versatility of this wireless set.
advertised or described as a headset then of course the quality of voice reproduction then it would be fair game for a slight negative rating, but as it is, this is a plus, a bonus feature.
I could not find any location within my apartment where there was a music dropout. Not even when I put my head and headphones were far into the refrigerator with the door acting as a metal shield between myself and my computer. Great Bluetooth coverage.
This is an excellent performer both for sound and battery life.
I have had them playing for over thirty five hours and have noticed no change in quality of sound or coverage. I don't doubt that seventy hours from a full charge is a realistic claim.
I am listening to a performance of ""Harold In Italy"" where the Pilgrims March has just begun.
In my opinion this is a super value for those wanting to be untethered from a computer desk, and to experience the freedom of wirless music listenihng and commlunications.

Update:
After seeing my review, Beben offered to send a replacement, which arrived quickly. The product looked the same. I wanted to give them a fair evaluation so I charged them over night. Then I didn't have a chance to use them for several days, mostly because I was not home. Beben emailed me on June 28th and 30th, and July 2nd, 6th, and 8th to request that I remove my review. That doesn't seem right. But an update seems fair.
The earbuds and charger look good. They're fairly comfortable even for small ears, and came with several rubbery earbud covers to fit well. They also have a convenient charger cable to connect to my laptop or USB wall outlet charger. Nice case. Arrived in good condition. Holds a charge for at least two hours. Pairs and connects well and stays connected, until I walk about 20' away from the paired device, when the sound cuts in and out, but didn't disconnect even when I walked from the back bedroom to the kitchen.

54,Looks and sounds good,"These earbuds are truly impressive and I have used quite a few. The design in black is sleek and modern, making them quite the stylish accessory. What's particularly good is their ability to stay securely in place during sports activities or while commuting on a bus or bike – a practical feature for us on-the-go folks.
The sound quality is quite exceptional, thanks in part to the ear tips that effectively block out ambient noise, elevating the overall music experience. The design choice to offer extra support behind the ears results in a slightly larger case, which is easily forgiven once you realize it supports wireless charging. Charging convenience is always a plus, right?
In conclusion, I can confidently recommend these earbuds. If you're a fellow enthusiast of running or active lifestyles, these earbuds could be your perfect companions. They strike a fine balance between style, functionality, and great sound.

5.0 out of 5 stars Great for the Gym
Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2023
These earbuds are great for working out. I weight lift and had trouble with AirPods falling out several times. The over the rad attachment was too expensive to make sense for me to buy after spending so much on the AirPods themselves. These earbuds are great quality for the money and exactly what I needed for the gym.
AirPods are basically the same but for ten times the price. These are much more affordable and practical for my budget. I do not need the most expensive, most popular earbuds when I am going to use them at the gym and get them sweaty and gross. This brand is reliable and makes good value products for the money. I will definitely buy their earbuds in the future. Buying products like this on Amazon is much more affordable than buying products from electronic stores or the mall. Will definitely buy from seller again.",Caio,2023-08-16,5,,False,False,0,True,offer extra support|slightly larger case|supports wireless charging|charging convenience|stay securely|sports activities|on-the-go folks|sound quality|ear tips|effectively block|ambient noise|music experience|ears results|easily forgiven|confidently recommend|fellow enthusiast|active lifestyles|perfect companions|fine balance|christopher daugherty 5|united states|weight lift|rad attachment|make sense|electronic stores|5 stars great|buying products|practical feature|design choice|ten times|makes good|gym reviewed|airpods falling|popular earbuds|Gym|AirPods|impressive|States on August|earbuds are great|United States|sleek and modern|stylish accessory|black is sleek|great sound|Buying products|great quality,0,"Looks and sounds good.

The design choice to offer extra support behind the ears results in a slightly larger case, which is easily forgiven once you realize it supports wireless charging. Charging convenience is always a plus, right? In conclusion, I can confidently recommend these earbuds. If you're a fellow enthusiast of running or active lifestyles, these earbuds could be your perfect companions. They strike a fine balance between style, functionality, and great sound. christopher daugherty 5.0 out of 5 stars Great for the Gym Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2023 These earbuds are great for working out. I weight lift and had trouble with AirPods falling out several times. The over the rad attachment was too expensive to make sense for me to buy after spending so much on the AirPods themselves. These earbuds are great quality for the money and exactly what I needed for the gym. AirPods are basically the same but for ten times the price. These are much more affordable and practical for my budget. I do not need the most expensive, most popular earbuds when I am going to use them at the gym and get them sweaty and gross. This brand is reliable and makes good value products for the money. I will definitely buy their earbuds in the future. Buying products like this on Amazon is much more affordable than buying products from electronic stores or the mall. Will definitely buy from seller again.",train

100,Boloxa A17 Bluetooth Earbuds Review - Your Buds for Sound and Comfort!,"I just got my hands on the Boloxa A17 Bluetooth Earbuds and am pretty excited to have these as my day to day ear buds. If you're all about hassle-free sound, music and comfort, keep reading.
The wireless charging case is a bit bigger than others that I've had but it's actually a great thing because I no longer am I going to go digging through my bag for a small case that's fallen to the bottom. Not only does the case keep your earbuds safe but it also shows how much juice they've got left with a large digital display.
Now, sound quality. I put on my favorite playlists on spotify and was blown away. The sound is clear as day, with some serious bass punch. Whether you're into music, podcasting or simply watching TV shows, these buds deliver the fantastic sound. Battery life is pretty amazing as well. I wore these through a workout session as well as many hours of netflix and hulu episodes throughout the evening and they didn't even break a sweat. Perfect for long commutes or even binge-watching sessions.
Oh, and they're waterproof. Not like ""Oops, it got wet"" waterproof – we're talking IPXX7 waterproof. Rain or sweat, these earbuds can take it. I actually put these on in the pool and have hung out for several hours without an issue - they sound the same after the fact. Let's not forget about those ear hooks. The wraparound earhooks are a game-changer. They're comfy, and they stay put. Whether you're on a brisk walk, maybe even jogging or just chilling, these earbuds won't casually pop out of your ears, as many have for me.
So all in all, I have to say that the Boloxa A17 Bluetooth Earbuds are a great deal. They are easy to operate, can withstand a lot of wear and probably tear (with the way I use things) and appear super sleek on your head. Put it all together with the wireless charging case, killer sound, long battery life, and snug fit, they're a no-brainer.

I ordered these primarily to use for workouts and to listen to music while studying. I had been looking into getting some quality true wireless earbuds for a while, but quite honestly I did not want to make the investment in AirPods. I think AirPods are all hype, especially after trying these earbuds out.
Pros:
- The sound quality was amazing and I was extremely impressed by the bass quality on these things. I listen to a wide variety of music genres but I am definitely a fan of songs with some bass in it, and these allowed me to enjoy such songs. I did not experience this with the AirPods
- The charging case and the earbuds themselves are super sleek. The earbuds magnetically connect to the charging case and the charging case also closes magnetically
- I was also surprised with how well a job these did with noise cancelling. I couldn't hear anybody talking to me while I had them in
- Pairing was super simple initially and now they connect automatically once I take them out of the case and automatically turn off once I replace them back in the case
- Siri and other command functions are very convenient
Cons:
- I was surprised with the fact there were command functions on these earbuds but I couldn't imagine someone who had hands any bit bigger than I did being able to use the tiny buttons with ease
- Talking on the phone I could hear the other person OK but my voice sounded mumbled
All in all these are an amazing alternative to AirPods for someone who wants totally wireless earbuds that are good quality, without the expense of AirPods.

218,A good bluetooth earbud with some connection issues. *UPDATED*,"Verified Purchase
I want to start this by saying I use this mainly in MONO mode, which is basically only using one earbud at a time. I find it rude to have both in when I am working so I only use one, and if one runs out of batteries I can just switch to the other.
I usually use another brand which no longer is being made or is currently unavailable. So I was on the lookout for a new set. I washed my old ones or lost one by accident...its always something that makes me replace them. They never died and they were work horses and I loved them.

That's the link to the ones I am talking about, these had the same kind of feel to the ones I had before with the ability to work in mono mode (they don't all do this)...and honestly this one doesn't really work well in mono mode either. *UPDATED* - I originally had issues with it not switching without me resetting the bluetooth settings, because it uses the same connection. While it still only uses one connection instead of two for each ear, the problem seem to have gone away and it connects properly, so I added a star.
Also, they occasionally will drop the connection. I don't know why. The phone is not moving, I am right next to it...but I lose the connection. It will reconnect in a few seconds, but it's still annoying. *UPDATED* This is still an issue. It happens maybe once or twice a day and it's a minor inconvenience. However that's why I took the star off for this.
I give it four stars because the sound is nice, and I like the case. It has magnets that will lock the earbud in place and there is a light on the earbud that shows when it is charging. *UPDATED* The loss of connection is what made me give it 4 out of 5 stars.",Wiiviewer,2020-04-26,4,black,True,False,0,True,verified purchase|mono mode|bluetooth settings|connects properly|minor inconvenience|Verified Purchase|MONO mode|UPDATED|connection|earbud|stars|made|give|find it rude|work in mono|time|start|basically|work horses,1,"A good bluetooth earbud with some connection issues. *UPDATED*.

98,A True Sports Companion,"I recently purchased the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations in every way! As someone who enjoys an active lifestyle, I needed a pair of earphones that could keep up with me during sports activities, particularly running. These earphones have been a game-changer for my workout routine.
One of the standout features of the BOLOXA A17 is the charging case. The quality of the case is excellent, and it provides a secure and convenient way to store and charge the earphones. I love the added feature of being able to see the battery percentage on the case. It allows me to plan my workouts better and ensures that I never run out of juice during extended sessions.
When it comes to the earphones themselves, they are specifically designed for sports enthusiasts like me. The ear hooks are fantastic! They fit snugly and securely around my ears, guaranteeing that the earphones won't fall off no matter how intense my activities get. This level of stability is crucial, and it gives me the confidence to focus solely on my workouts without any distractions.
Connecting the earphones to my phone is a breeze. The Bluetooth pairing is lightning-fast, which means I spend less time fiddling with settings and more time enjoying my favorite tunes. The sound quality is surprisingly good for the price. The audio is clear, and the bass is punchy enough to keep me motivated throughout my entire run.
I also appreciate the durability of these earphones. They have endured a fair share of accidental drops and still work flawlessly. It's evident that BOLOXA has put a lot of thought into the design and construction of these headphones.
In conclusion, the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones are a fantastic choice for sports enthusiasts and fitness fanatics. The charging case with the battery percentage indicator is a thoughtful addition, and the secure ear hooks ensure a worry-free workout experience. The quick and stable Bluetooth connection, along with the impressive sound quality, makes them a steal at this price point.

Who cares if a set of earbuds sound phenomenal but you can't stand to have them in your ears???

I bought these because I was looking for a set of earbuds that I could use while swimming and in the hot tub. These work very well for that. They fit my ear snugly (using the appropriately sized ear gels), the sound is great and the battery lasts for longer than I am in the pool or hot tub! I like the feel of a physical button on each ear bud since it makes a positive ""click"" feel so you know you have pressed the button. I really like the fact that the case has an internal battery that can give me a few full charges of the earbuds without having to recharge the case all the time. I can see that being really useful when I go to the beach and don't have a source of power nearby so that I can listen to music all day.
I wore the earbuds to bed to see how they feel when drifting off to sleep. They feel OK but protrude out of my ear a bit too much so that when I'm laying on my side, there is some pressure on my ear (could just be an issue with the shape of my ear). The other issue I had when trying to use these while going to sleep is that, paired with my iPhone, I can't get the volume down low enough so the minimal volume level is just a bit too loud to comfortably fall asleep to.

31,"An ideal blend of function, form, and performance in a budget-friendly package","The A17-series earbuds have clearly blended the best of prior models into a clean and well-functioning successor. Right out of the box, the quality shows with the case, which supports both wireless and USB-C charging, permits easy removal of the earbuds, and has a very nice heft & snap. The earbuds themselves are extremely comfortable, fit securely even during vigorous exercise, and paired straight-away. The new Bluetooth 5.3 chipset shows demonstrable advantages over the previous 4.0 standard with noticeably faster reconnection and reception - where an older BT4-based earbud would drop out due to distance or obstruction, the A17s keep going. I've been very happy with the sound quality - from audiobooks to classical to hard-hitting workout tracks, the audio came through clearly and with a full spectrum; you may want to swap the silicone earbud shields with one of the other sizes to tailor the fit, which allows for even better noise isolation and bass response.

I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase of the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones. From the moment I unwrapped them, I knew I was in for a treat. The design is sleek and stylish, and the build quality feels premium.
The sound quality is simply outstanding. The headphones deliver crystal-clear audio with rich bass and crisp highs. Whether I'm listening to my favorite music or watching a movie, the immersive experience provided by these headphones is unparalleled.
The Bluetooth connectivity is seamless, and the wireless range is impressive. I can move around my house without any signal dropouts, which is incredibly convenient.
Comfort is key for me when it comes to headphones, and the BOLOXA A17 doesn't disappoint. The ear cups are soft and cushioned, and the adjustable headband ensures a snug fit. I can wear them for hours on end without any discomfort.
Battery life is excellent too. I've used them for extended periods, and they still had plenty of power left. Charging is quick and hassle-free.
On top of all that, the built-in microphone works flawlessly during phone calls, delivering clear voice quality to the other end.
Overall, the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones have exceeded my expectations in every way. They offer a premium listening experience, comfort for extended use, and reliable functionality. I highly recommend them to anyone in need of top-notch Bluetooth headphones.

373,Great product for the price.,"-RedVerified Purchase
I have had wireless ear buds, and I always have the same issue - they either are very insecure, or are very easy to lose. In my case, I tend to lose them eventually, no matter how much I try to watch them like a hawk, they just seem to disappear eventually. So I wanted just plain over the ear, old school headphones, that are still wireless, because something connected and this size is very hard to lose.
I have used them every day at work for nearly a year, I get 2-3 hours a night of use from them, charging them about once every 2 weeks. I listen to alot of music, and podcasts, and in both areas they seem great to me, but I am 100% not an ""Audiophile"", just a normal guy listening to what I like, and to me I have no complaints.
I really wanted ones that had a metal band and metal hinges. I have had gaming headsets that had plastic bands, or hinges and when they break - nothing can fix broken plastic, and they just have to be thrown out, even if the headphones themselves still work, you can't wear them any more. So having metal bands and hinges mattered alot to me, and so far, a year later, they are doing great.

115,The BeBen Bluetooth 5.0 earbuds are Spectacular!,"Verified Purchase
LIKE
For starters: I’ve spent “3 times” as much money on earbuds that didn’t sound even “half” as great as the BeBen Bluetooth 5.0. The pairing was the most intuitive and problem free of any earbud I’ve used. I literally took them out of the box and watched them pair up with my Samsung S9+ no muss no fuss. The sound was nothing short of spectacular. Of course all of this is standard fare so I want to briefly point out a few features that stood out in distinction with this unit. I really appreciated the status notification in my S9+ settings that displayed the percentage of earbud charge remaining. In addition, the lights in the circular charge case incrementally lit up along with the light on each of the earbuds that provided clear notification when my buds were fully charged. One of the biggest surprises is that, unlike many other earbuds, you can touch and readjust the BeBens in your ear without disconnecting your tunes or (more importantly) your call. This is a “huge” benefit if you also use your earbuds to chat with co-workers and clients throughout the day. Last but not least is a feature that has never worked before for any earbud I’ve owned. The BeBen bluetooth 5.0 is the very first earbud that’s shaped to actually stay in my ear and not fall out or shift when I turn my head or lean over. That makes all the difference in the world for supreme comfort in listening pleasure!
DISLIKE
I generally wait 30 days before posting a review to make sure I’ve been thorough. A few days ago I noticed the right earbud volume was dramatically lower than the left. I looked up the Amazon support troubleshooting documentation and found a couple of videos and suggestions that failed to resolve the problem. I spoke with Amazon support (who were excellent) and stepped through a number of other procedures (removing then resetting the earbuds etc.) to no avail. It appears to be a defect with pairing that may occur if you only take one earbud out at a time (instead of simultaneously) . I was sent a replacement unit that arrived in 3-4 days and worked perfectly. I noticed the replacement unit came with a USB C charger cable instead of the USB A charger cable from the previous unit (although it’s not clear whether that’s a relevant factor with the malfunction).
My strong recommendation is to buy one of these units for home use and test it out before buying another pair for work.

I haven't done a full battery life check yet but the few hours I used them I still had 85% battery life left. The EQ give some options but mot a hugh difference. They are easy to fold up and store away. I did not talk through them not why I got them. Over all good quality for the price. Highly recommend",train
189,"Emphasis in the highs and the higher lows, value buy","Verified Purchase
Nothing has been able to top my TRN paried with ZS7s, but these so far are the second best. I've tried a ton of bluetooth earphones and this was a relief to test. Out of the ankers (one of which I've returned) and other Chinese brands, these earphones have exceeded my expectations, but they weren't too high to begin with.
Initially, the response leans heavily in the high and some in the lower mid-high low frequencies. Anything in between is rather muddy and difficult to discern. It makes you a bit thirsty for what's missing. However, after about 14-16 hours of usage, the drivers began to deliver more of the lower frequency and the highs weren't so assaulting on the ears. It was a dramatic change, and it definitely puts the earphones higher on my list.
These are great for daily usage, and I wouldn't hate myself for losing these.
I haven't tested battery life yet. The earphones come with extra rubbers so the fit is perfect. They're also pretty light, and lengthy usage didn't hurt my ears.
By far, the biggest relief, is that each earphone is independent: the first one on will pair as a master, so you'll always be able to put the other back into the case to charge.
You'd be really silly to expect great response and dynamic range for the price you are paying. There are some significant cons, but when you look at the price you're paying, I can't imagine why anyone would complain.",Rie,2020-05-18,5,black,False,False,1,True,response leans heavily|tested battery life|expect great response|verified purchase|trn paried|chinese brands|bit thirsty|14-16 hours|drivers began|lower frequency|dramatic change|extra rubbers|pretty light|dynamic range|significant cons|daily usage|lengthy usage|earphones higher|biggest relief|Verified Purchase|top my TRN|TRN paried|Chinese brands|bluetooth earphones|ears|price|paying|ton of bluetooth,1,"Emphasis in the highs and the higher lows, value buy.

14,A Symphony for Your Ears - BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth Headphones!,"I recently purchased the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth headphones and, let me tell you, they are a total game-changer! From the first moment, the unboxing experience to the amazing sound quality, everything about these headphones exceeded my expectations.
The Hi-Fi stereo sound is absolutely mind-blowing, transforming every song into a live concert experience. Whether it's blasting some rock and roll during a morning jog or immersing myself in a symphony during a quiet evening, the BOLOXA A17 delivers a top-tier audio experience every time.
One of my favorite features is the wireless charging and digital display. It's incredibly convenient and takes away the hassle of dealing with tangled cables. The digital display shows the battery life clearly, so I never have to worry about my headphones dying on me during a workout or a call.
Speaking of battery life, it's been phenomenal. I can go days without needing a recharge, even with heavy use. This feature has made these headphones my constant companion, from early morning exercise sessions to late-night movie marathons.
The comfort is simply unbeatable. I have worn these for hours at a time without any discomfort. The snug fit ensures they stay in place, regardless of how intense my workout gets. They're also perfect for long hours of remote work or travel.
Let's not forget the IPX7 waterproof rating! These headphones have survived rainstorms during my runs and heavy sweating during intense workouts. The fact that they are so durable yet deliver high-quality sound is simply outstanding.
The vibrant red color and over-ear design give the BOLOXA A17 headphones a sleek, stylish look that I absolutely love. They're not just headphones; they're a fashion statement.
For the price, the quality, comfort, and features of the BOLOXA A17 Bluetooth headphones are unmatched. If you're in the market for a reliable pair of headphones that will revolutionize your audio experience, look no further. I wholeheartedly recommend these headphones and can assure you that they are worth every penny!

16,Great Immersive Impressive sound,"I have had numerous BT headphones of all sizes and styles. I consider myself a bit of an audiophile with a rather expensive theater in my living room (Dolby digital 7.1 with 1000+ watt Yamaha receiver and 7 Infinity speakers and Yamaha Powered sub). My vehicles all have upgraded custom audio as well. given that, I've not heard earphones with this level of dynamic range until getting into the $150-$200 range (Beats or Bose type equipment). I listen to a wide range of music (celtic, 80's-90's rock, Christian Rock, Gospel, Country, and a lot of Classical instrumental) and these provide deep bass and pretty clear highs.
I really love the over-the-ear design as they tend to stay fitted on my ear well even when being pretty active (I work in a shop and around a farm). They are comfortable after numerous hours of wearing.
As for user ease, they are very intuitive. I posted a picture of the instruction manual and with a button on each unit, you can increase volume or skip tracks very easily. They charge via USB C interface and a short cable is provided. There is a great digital display in the case to tell you remaining battery life in the base unit and when you drop each earphone into its slot, there is a battery level bar indicator that appears briefly to let you know the status of that headphone.
They have paired with my laptop, PC, and phone within 10 seconds of searching. And I found out today that the line of sight range (outdoors with phone on bench and me blowing leaves) is probably over 100 ft. (with no obstructions of course). Once I did get out of range and lost connection, there is a vocal alert in the phones to tell you that and as I came back closer to my phone, they rapidly re-connected.

I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of these earbuds. My go-to headphones for travel have always been the Bose QC-35 ii over the ear and Jaybird X2s for hiking or working out. I can honestly say that these buds sound 1000x better than my Jaybirds (which were SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive). The BEBEN buds have a surprising amount of low end bass and provide really solid sound isolation. The highs are crisp and lows hit very strong at medium to high volumes. Mids could be a bit fuller, but honestly these have a great sound profile for EDM and podcast/audio book listening.
The buds are very light and comfortable on the ears - so far they have been in for an hour straight and no apparent discomfort. Pairing is seamless, and the case footprint is significantly smaller than I thought from the photos. The case is approximately 2 inches in diameter and inch and a half thick, so it packs really well.
My only gripe with these buds are the button controls - they are not very intuitive and a bit of a pain to press down, as the buds are lodged in your ears. If you are running, and want to change volume up or down, you have to stop, grip the buds with your thumb and middle finger and hold down the button on either left or right headphone. Doing away with the buttons altogether and using a touch sensitive surface would make the usability of these much better. Nonetheless, you really cant beat these for the price.",J.

379,Shockingly good,"TL:DR at the top - For $20 you are NOT going to find a better wireless headphone. Battery life is exceptional, it has three built in EQ modes which I personally *love*, battery life is incredible, and, if you do actually need to use them wired, they actually sound great as regular wired headphones, too!
They do not, as far as I can tell, have a microphone, and the driver is >40mm but you have to make sacrifices to get the cost down. The noise isolation, even without ANC, is incredible. If you have unusually massive ears the ear cups might be closer to ""on ear"" than ""over ear"" but for I'd say, 90% of people they should fit right over your ears just fine.
Full review:
If you've seen my past headphone reviews, you know already that I will not hesitate to verbally tear into a product that doesn't live up to its price point, especially when it can't even do the thing it's supposed to do (i.e. not sound like two tin cans strung together)
Conversely if something performs beyond my expectations, especially at its price point, then you'd better believe I'm going to sing its praises to anyone who'll listen.
Some important information up front: these are CLOSED BACK headphones with a thick ear cup. This means that you are going to get sound isolation passively, but this also means they aren't going to sound the same as an open back headphone. The sound is going to literally sound more ""closed off"" without the EQ presets (or your own EQ on your device of choice).
That effectively means that listening in wired mode will sound different from smaller on ear headphones or open back headphones. That's just the trade off for passive noise isolation.
There is no active noise cancelling feature, and no microphones. You can't expect that at this price point, anyway honestly. I have a pair of BT earbuds in this price range that have passthrough, and the audio is so bad on those microphones that I just take them out entirely if I need to hear something ;)
Battery life is, as far as I can tell, as advertised, meaning I haven't had to charge them yet, and I've had these for about two weeks now.
They fold easily, which can be a good or a bad thing depending on your point of view. The folding hinges could be a point of failure, but I once had a pair of $300 audiophile headphones that quite literally fell apart within 3 months due to the same failure point, so ore expensive is not better in this department.
I'd rather have a set of $20 headphones fall apart than $300 ones *any* day.
Final thoughts: I know these are probably just white label Chinese headphones (meaning a white label factory manufactures them, and someone else slaps their branding on to sell them), but if this factory started making Actige Noise Cancelling headphones of this quality, I wouldn't look for a review sample on Vine. I'd spend my actual real world money on them.

This is my first foray into true wireless buds. I was never interested because I assumed they would fall out, and did not want to waste a large amount of money on something I would lose, or in the case of ear pods, would suffer a short life due to battery decline.
The price of this set was right. It had many good reviews (more about that in a moment) so I decided to try them. I happy I did.
Excellent sound quality. Noise cancellation seems to be for real. Battery so far has exceeded expectations. I like the compact charging case. It is nice because the case itself can hold a charge and charge the buds even if the case is not plugged in.
When paired with my phone, the buds kept a rock solid connection, even when I was downstairs and pods were upstairs.
They stay in with no issue and come with 6 different tip sizes. I use the smallest ones for sleeping, and the buds are comfortable enough to fall asleep in.
I did not love the connection I achieved with my Apple Watch. I went for a run, and I could not hold a good, consistent connection. I wear my watch on my left wrist. Not sure if that matters.
A card in the package offers a free one year warranty to those who provide feed back on the purchase and, if they can, leave a five star review on Amazon. So that might explain the number of five star reviews. I give it five stars despite my issues with maintaining a connection to my watch on a run because I think these buds offer a tremendous value, and I have no intention to use them for running anyway.

403,Good set of cans.,Not too bad for a budget set of cans! Sound is pretty good. Not audiophile quality for sure. 3 EQ modes let you control how you listen.

197,Decent Quality All-Purpose Headphones,"Verified Purchase
For what you paid, you're getting a pretty good deal. These little guys are comparable (in performance) to AirPods, but at a fraction of the cost. Here's the lowdown:
WHAT I LIKE:
- Ear ""sealing"" design: Take both of your fingers and plug your ears. This is what it sounds like when these are in your ears. Definitely masks out outside audio.
- Sleek black design
- Simple bluetooth setup
- 6x size options to perfectly fit your ear
- 5-6 hour music streaming capabilities (That's all the AirPods have, too...)
- Audio quality is on par with what I'd expect from other headphones.
WHAT I DON'T LOVE:
- Voice quality: when using video calling or phone calls, these guys add a little raspiness to the call. Not a huge deal, but definitely something I notice in audio performance.
- Not a US-based product: The manual / graphics / branding try to look like a US product, but it's clearly a Asian knockoff. There's grammatical errors and Chinese-esque graphics / fonts. I threw all that crap away already, so nothing to worry about anymore. My pride is over it!
OTHER NOTES:
- FIT: when I first put them in, I couldn't get them to stay in nicely. I then learned that you need to rotate them 90 degrees so that the outer tab of your ear holds them in. Now they stay in really well!

198,Very good for casual use.,"Verified Purchase
As a disclaimer, I am not an audiophile and only use these for casual use, such as watching videos or listening to background music while working, thus I cannot refute or support some of the other reviews that claim to have ""great audio at XX frequencies.""
However, I will say these are adequate and good earbuds for what I do with them. The sound isolation is about as good as you can get without active noise cancelling for earbuds. Though you can still hear outside noise with the earbuds in but without something playing, if you then turn them on with some soft music (I use calming piano music a lot), you will almost completely isolate yourself from the outside.
The pairing process is also very simple. No weird pairing codes or anything, just find on my device, click, and then they automatically pair in the future.
Battery life has lasted for the entire day so far. Can't comment on how long the battery stays this way, but it has been good for the last week.
I am, however, a bit scared that these might fall out if I move around too much, even though it hasn't happened. These are somewhat bulky, and I have tested how well they stay in by vigorously shaking my head. It feels like they may be getting looser, but I get dizzy before I can shake my head enough for them to fall out.

138,"For the price, these are an absolute steal.","Verified Purchase
The sound quality is what stands out to me the most. It's really, really clear. The bass could be a little stronger, but for $30 headphones, these are better overall than any I've gotten before ... and also the cheapest Bluetooth headphones I've bought.
I have always had trouble with earbuds staying in my ears, but with the shape of the body of each earbud, these stays in snug. I can even go running with these and they stay snug right behind the antitragus of my ear. To be honest, I avoided wireless earbuds for awhile due to the liability of them popping out and getting lost (i.e. over a storm drain on the street or into the door crease in an elevator), but my worries have been quelled with how these fit. While on the point of ""fit,"" they also come with 4 different rubber earpiece sizes, which is the most I've ever received with any earbuds I've bought. That's awesome.
Water proof/resistance is a huge plus, although I haven't hard tested them that way, it's nice to know if they catch a splash, they should be fine.
The signal range seems to come in a little short ... somewhere around 25 ft., but that's also not a huge issue for me as I'm not usually running around a latge warehouse or something without my phone.
The battery case is my 2nd favorite feature next to sound quality. That is a huge convenience. My last pair of Bluetooth headphones were $40, have poorer sound quality and no battery case, although their range was around 40 ft.
My 3rd favorite feature is that you can use just 1 earbud if you want, effectively doubling the advertised battery life of the set (6h earbuds + 24h case = 30 total. Both earbuds have a microphone, so if you're doing a lot of talking on the phone with them and don't need the stereo sound, you're going to be good for a long time.
Bluetooth pairing was also really simple and quick and flawless.

These earbuds are all you need for an earbuds. The sound quality is about what you'd expect for an earbud. But you never feel like it is too quiet. Half the time I have the volume on near silent because it can go so loud.
The battery is also pretty good lasting about 10 hours from my experience. If you don't use your phone and let them go on standby they can last longer. The included charging case usually fills up in around an hour while being able to fully charge the earbuds around 3 times so pretty happy with the battery life.
I constantly see poor reviews for earbuds that cost more than $100 but I have rarely seen anything bad said about those in the $30-$50 price range. I think beyond that point the rest of the features are more gimmicky if anything. If you want the best, secure and low profile earbud you can find on the market then here you go.
The only complaint I have would be that there is no software paired with the product to adjust the volume on your phone or pause it there. Using the buttons on earbud are a pain since your are pressing them deeper into your ear if you use one hand so you have to kind of hold the bud with your middle finger and thumb while pressing the button with your index finger which when on the go it's better to just unlock your phone and pause or raise the volume through there.

I'm not jumping around or anything, maybe I'm not wearing them correctly?? Anyway it fell out of my ear once while on a ladder, it survived. Next it fell off into my paint bucket. Not so good results,.... It still works fine after a good cleaning but what a pain in both situations",Bill,2020-05-10,4,black,False,False,0,True,verified purchase|professional painter|paint bucket|works fine|good results|good cleaning|Verified Purchase|fell|sound quality|earbuds|couple times|ends|correctly|ladder|survived|thing|fallen,1,"Great value.

These headphones are great for listening, but recommend you look elsewhere if you plan to use them for phonecalls.
I'm not an audio expert and may not be the best at detecting audio details, but I compared them to two other headphones I've used and they seem comparable. The volume is really good, surprised by how loud they can get. Bass seems strong too.
The fit was good once I changed the tips to the smaller/narrower version that allowed the earbud to fit deeper into my ear. They stuck out a bit too much before making that change but they're surprisingly snug after changing the tips.
That snug fit means they don't really budge much when I press the buttons. I think they fit deep enough that when I press the buttons, the upper portion of the bud rests against the outer hollowed part of my ear so my ear canal doesn't get the brunt of the pressure. They stay very secure while running too.
There's no active noise cancellation but the snug fit naturally does a good job at blocking out noise.
Don't plan on using these regularly for phone calls. Great for listening, but the other person won't be able to hear you well. Mic is terrible.
The connection seems to be very strong. I walk by a spot that apparently has a lot of signal noise and it ALWAYS caused my last headphones to lag/jump. Testing these new ones twice, there have been no lags/jump when walking by that same spot.
Just like all other headphones I've had, the battery percentage shows in 10% increments on my Pixel so you won't see the exact battery percentage. I believe this is an Android thing with any headphones (other than Pixel buds I imagine).
I was impressed by how small the buds and the case actually are. Really compact.
I haven't tested other true-wireless ear buds but these seem to be great, especially for the price.
Will update if battery, or other, issues start to arise.",Matt,2020-02-26,5,black,False,False,1,True,outer hollowed part|battery percentage shows|exact battery percentage|active noise cancellation|snug fit means|snug fit naturally|true-wireless ear buds|surprisingly snug|audio expert|fit deeper|verified purchase|smaller/narrower version|upper portion|bud rests|phone calls|signal noise|10% increments|android thing|issues start|ear canal|pixel buds|good job|Verified Purchase|headphones|press the buttons|Pixel|detecting audio details|great for listening,1,"Recommended for listening but not for talking.
