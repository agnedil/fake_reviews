I originally got these for my wife. After seeing how much she enjoyed this head set i decided i should get a pair as well. I waited about a month before writing this review due to the fact i use these far more than my wife dose. Using them for 4-6 hours pre day.
The Bluetooth range is amazing, spanding about 100 feet through several hard wood walls. I use them alot when doing yard work and the ear padding is extremely comfortable and the sweat wicks off them easily. Over the corse of a month at around 4-6 hours a day i have only had to charge these around 3 times. The mic is also crystal clear . The only thing i would give a low review on is the noise cancellation. It does work but not as well as some of your other higher end headsets. All in all for the price these are a must have
Update: its been slighly over a year and i use them daily for sevral hours each day. They still work perfectly!!!!!!

5.0 out of 5 stars Great for mowing

I purchased these to replace a pair I've had for a few years that are just getting ratty looking. These are better at cancelling out the noise of my mower, and the sound quality of the music is really good! Easy to use - I mow for about 4 hours at a time and they last easily for that length of time. I just recharge them after each time I mow, so I can't really comment on the actual length of time they hold the charge.

Very comfortable headphones to wear. As a person wearing glasses, it is almost impossible to get a good fit where it is not pressing on the legs of my glasses. These headphones are fine addressing that problem but what I like is the foam is really soft and fits well on my ears.
I was very impressed with the automatic noise cancelling feature. You can really tell the difference when you turn it that is suppresses the background white noise.
Charge holds okay but it will take time to really have an opinion on it.
Happy with the headphones.

These headphones are light (7oz) and comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.
Sound quality is very good: rich bass and good overall sound rendition.
Noise cancellation: I tested it with people speaking in a room, street noise, various background home noises and specific appliance noises. Overall it is pretty good, particularly with common background noises: voices, street noise and lower tones noises.
Operations: pairing is very easy and overall operations are simple enough.
Battery: I still had power after 4hrs of constant usage.

In short: a very good product for the price and I would buy it again.

Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2022

These headphones are very comfortable to wear. I appreciate the marks on the band showing how far they are extended, making it easy to go back to your preferred fit. The padding is not very thick, but the tension of the headband makes cups sit comfortably on the ears. Wearing them for a long time does not cause any issues.

The buttons have a good feel and are easy to use even when wearing gloves. The noise cancellation is a separate on/off switch, which is convenient. Noise cancellation works well--switching it on creates a noticeable reduction in ambient sounds.

The sound quality is solid. It is balanced, without booming bass or any other strange equalizer choices. Voices are clear and music is crisp.

This is a best Bluetooth headphone one can get just in $36. Overall, it is very good headphone, very easy to setup, easy to connect afterwards, very good sound quality and battery life.

Sound: It has very good sound quality, it sounds very clear and pleasant. It has balanced equalizer for bass and treble.

Battery: I think battery life is best feature of this headphone, I have been using this for headphone for almost 3 weeks, averaging ~2 hours per work day and it has still more than 50% battery remaining.

ANC: It seems noise cancellation feature is okay, it does work for minor sounds, I feels it is blocking enough sound, but I haven't used other ANC headphones, so cannot compare it.

Mic: I haven't used mic for this headphone, so cannot comment on it. I generally don't use mic from Bluetooth headphone much as it won't be in front of face.

5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sounds! Lightweight and Cool Design,
Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2022
 This set of Bluetooth Headphones is easily one of the best I've ever come across, and here's why:

* Overall Impression: this headset comes in BLACK that exudes class & quality like a tuxedo or black limousine. It's shaped perfectly around my head & ear contours, it's so cool looking❗❗
* Sounds: this sub-$100 Bluetooth Headset measures up with all the more famous brands, it covers all dynamic ranges equally well from trebles to bass, I was blown away❗
* Noise Cancellation: With ANC 918 certified, this blocks away those annoying ambient noises, like crying babies on the airplane, or crowd noises on the subway, or while in office, coworkers chatting away while attempting to work❗
* > 1 BT Connectivity: I've never had one that permits my BT headset to connect to two devices at the same time! This means I can talk on my cellphone, and listen to music originating from my tablet, or any other Bluetooth-capable devices! This is amazingly convenient, as I no longer need to disconnect one in order to connect to another! WOW👍
* Long Playtime: nearly 20+ hours on a single charge
* Lightweight: this thing weighs merely just over 1 lb, it's incredibly comfortable ❗
* Value: all of the above for about $50, C'MON now

In summary, this Bluetooth Headphones is packed with features, lightweight, cool-looking, Dual Wired-&-Wireless Mode, & Multi-device Bluetooth connectivity all at below $60. Highly recommended!!

Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2022
What’s not to love about noise canceling headphones? I’m one who enjoys to have a peace of mind, with no interruptions when it comes to listening to music and/or watching my favorite movie or TV show.

Upon ordering these, the purpose was to have something that could help me go to sleep prior to going to work. These allow me to listen to some smooth jazz AND have the comfort of being able to go to sleep. These fit right over the head and doesn’t pinch the ears, a major pro with these. They’re also inexpensive compared to most on the market today. By the way, you don’t have to worry about being an inconvenience to anyone around you. You can hardly hear anything coming from the headphones .. in the event you don’t have them on, you won’t be disturbed!

One of the cons has been the fact that I didn’t order another pair. My wife has enjoyed these headphones more than I have I believe. Ha

Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2022
It's been a couple of weeks since I've been using this product, and I can now confidently say, this is one of the best price-to-value products I've ever used. Keep in mind that this is still a $35 pair of headphones, so take everything with a grain of salt. That being said, the noise cancellation is great, the sound quality was surprisingly very nice (cheaper headphones tend to have a static-y background noise to them, these did not), they last very long for a single charge, the build quality feels very premium for only $35, the plastic is nice, the leather is comfortable, and they are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I'd recommend these headphones to anyone looking for afforable, wireless, comfortable headphones.

4.0 out of 5 stars Great battery life. Poor noise cancelation.
Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2022
My wife purchased these as a gift. I work a a maintenance technician in a manufacturing environment. After +30 years in noisy environments, I am beginning to experience some hearing loss and tinnitus. It is important for me to protect my hearing.

Without any regard to music quality, these earphones do provide some noise protection but they are not nearly as protective as specifically designed hearing protection. My noise exposure is more constant background drone and not so much extreme loud. I find they work well as simple noise protection.

When I am listening to music I typically play it on a low level. I work 12hr shift and they will easily go for a full 4 shifts (48hrs) before needed to be recharged. The battery life is great. I assume the battery life would be somewhat shortened if played at high volume...but because I'm trying to protect my hearing, not lose it, I don't play at high volume.

I find that they are comfortable and fit me well me. I have seen reviews claiming they are not comfortable. Comfort and fitment are highly subjective. Each person has a different level of comfort. Also each person has slightly different head and ear shape/size. What fits and is comfortable for me, might be different for someone else.

Where these headphones fall short is the active noise cancellation. When turning on the ACN switch it sounds more like a simple high pass filter. The sound quality gets "tinny" and sounds like mostly treble, all of the low frequency is gone. I understand that for the price I was not expecting Boise type noise reduction (yes, I tried a co-worker's pair of Boise QuiteComfort 45).

I have not tried to pair these with my phone for taking calls so I cannot rate or comment on those features.

Overall, I find these to be very good given the low price. I'm seriously considering a second pair of these for use at home for use when doing yard work and other noisy jobs.

This set is pretty good sounding for those not wanting or unable to spend big bucks. Bought for after my surgery so I could listen to some music without disturbing others or hear their choice of tv programs. Normally use power beats pro while mowing so I gave these a shot.
Totally comfortable, little inner ear area sweating, cut out most of the mower sound (including an annoying neighbor who always tries to talk to me when I’m working).
Our three year old grandson gave them a try & sat for an hour watching his iPad which hub was grateful not to hear the same Disney movie for the 80th time! - just be sure to adjust volume on yourself first.
My only con, make sure you hold the power button off after disconnecting charger cord. Even in off slide position they connect and turn themselves on. First time I unplugged & put in case to travel I couldn’t figure out what was wrong with my phone for about fifteen minutes. Discovered it had connected to set without even being turned on.

5.0 out of 5 stars Skeptical at first...
Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
- EXPECTATION: I bought these hoping to get a good set of wireless earbuds that could charge easily and quickly, not fall out of my ears, connect to my android phone no problem, and withstand water enough to shower and exercise. I literally got all of this in one package! I've had these for over two weeks and I really love them. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for the same things.

- ACCESSORIES: The buds charge in a magnetic case that is round, small, lightweight, and portable. It comes with a braided wrist loop (optional) in case you want to attach it to a bag or something. The buds snap into place to charge, and they charge instantly and automatically when the case has some battery to it (and you charge the case via the included microUSB cable). Also, I found it super helpful because they included SO MANY earbud replacement squishies. My ears are fairly small and I imagine such an assortment of squishies could fit anyone's preferences.

- SHOWER/EXERCISE/USE: I've run with these and taken showers in these. Both buds are working as perfectly as they did the first day. I love to work in these because I don't have to worry about tripping over wires, having my phone fall out of my pocket and pulling my earbuds out, getting the wires in the sink doing dishes, or trying to aim my voice at the tiny microphone box on my old wired earbuds.

- PAIRING: Using the buttons on these is really intuitive if you've used any technology before. One click is pause, two clicks is go forward/skip, etc. Pairing is relatively easy too. I had a little trouble at first getting them to pair at the same time, but there are instructions included that address this issue. I like that when I walk outside (I only wear one bud when I'm outside so I can stay more alert to traffic) all the sound goes through the one earbud I'm using. I can leave the other earbud in its case charging at my house. No issues with this at all!

- CALLS: One time I was outside on a windy day and my sister started to call me and I was concerned that she wouldn't be able to hear me (this was the first time I was taking a call with the earbuds). Piece of cake! She heard me fine through the one earbud I was using and I didn't have to press any buttons or worry about anything.

- OVERALL: Love this product! Got so excited that I bought my brother some and he loves them too. He can lift weights now without worrying about the wires and can talk to his friends more easily. Literally the only issue with them that I have is that they're so small and convenient, I have them in all the time. And they're so compact that sometimes other people can't tell I'm wearing them! They see me apparently talking to myself like a crazy person or they'll try to talk to me and I can't hear them 'cause I'm jamming' to music :)

Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2020

I currently own three pairs of bluetooth earbuds. One pair is great overall but not very comfortable. The other pair is much more comfortable but has some annoying quirks like having to pair twice for using one earbud vs two and causing my phone's volume to shoot to 100% every time they connect.

So far, this pair has passed all of my tests:

1) Sound quality is great. Plenty of bass without muddying the mid-range and crisp clear highs. They honestly sound really great (especially for their price).

2) These connect to my phone quickly and allow me to switch between stereo and mono with minimal interruption. Stereo to mono is instant. Mono to stereo causes a brief pause while the earbuds inform me of which is primary and which is secondary but this is okay. No weird volume jumps on connection and you only have to pair once to use the buds in all variations of L, R, and L+R.

3) No noticeable audio lag. One of my pairs of earbuds has about a 300 ms lag, which makes watching any kind of video rather annoying since audio is out of sync with the video. With these, a/v sync is spot on.

4) Well designed case with a magnetic lid and strong magnets to hold the earbuds against the charge pins. With these, I don't feel like I have to worry about them shifting off of the pins and randomly connecting to my phone, or killing themselves in the case. They're pulled firmly into position and I don't have to wiggle them around to get the pins to connect. I plan to purchase an extra wireless charger to test the case's wireless charging ability, which is a very thoughtful addition by the designer, since this technology is very cheap to implement but adds functionality and convenience.

5) The most important test of all: comfort. These are sized nicely. They fit well in my ears without having to force them into place, yet they don't feel like they will fall out. They're very light and don't put pressure any parts of my ear. I haven't used them for an extended period yet, so I can't speak for their comfort over more than an hour or so, but they already feel better than my other earbuds.

All in all, I've found my new favorite pair out of my three. One of my pairs was a gift, so I intend to hang onto them but I may pass my other pair to someone else since I don't think they'll be seeing much use moving forward.

Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
All I can say is: you need to get these headphones! The quality in the design, fit, and sound is impressive.
I am always looking for the *perfect* pair of headphones that fit in my ears well, aren’t heavy, and don’t fall out after considerable wear throughout a day. I do a lot of talking throughout the day for work as well as use them for yardwork on the weekends. Every pair of headphones I seem to purchase only fits well for a short period of time and ends up falling out after talking for only 30 minutes. Enter the Beben X8 headphones!
The box comes with SIX sets of earbud tips that are sure to conform to your personal ear. This seems to always be my problem, but it’s not an issue with these headphones. In addition, the packaging contains the headphone, the charging/carry case, a (short) MicroUSB cable, and a lanyard attachment for your charging/carrying case. It is a nice compact design for easy transport or storage.

The pairing process is easy, but you first need to PULL OFF THE PLASTIC on the underside of each ear bud that protects it from the charging pins in the case. Before you charge the units or use them, make sure to do this so you aren’t frustrated after you realize it “isn’t charging.”

The sound quality is superb. The deep bass and clear audio is great for nearly any music type. Adjusting the volume is a breeze, simply hold down on the left to adjust volume down and hold down the button on the right bud to increase the volume. Want to go backward to the previous song? Just double tap the right ear bud. If you want to forward to the next song, double tap the left ear bud. Want to access your preferred Assistant? Just triple-tap the left earbud.

Pros:
-Compact design
-Great packaging that includes numerous earbuds
-Lightweight
-Stays put in your ear for extended periods of time, even when there is significant jaw movement
-Sound quality is great
-Call quality is pretty good for both callers
-Great with Zoom for conference calls!
-1 Year warranty
-Easy Pairing and setup (Android / Windows – iOS not tested)

Cons:
-No audio passthrough/amplification so you can “hear” the sounds around you
-Only able to see that the case Is charging/charged when connected to a cable by opening the case lid to view LEDs. No external LEDs
-No auto pause of audio when buds are removed from ears

Overall, I am extremely pleased with these headphones. The sound quality is far better than anticipated and they hold strong in my ears without budging. These are the real deal in terms of ergonomics and sound quality. There are a few items left to be desired as noted in my Cons list, but these aren’t deal breakers by any means. You’ll be happy you purchased these!

5.0 out of 5 stars The Sleeper Brand of Ear Buds
Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
I have been through a few pairs of true wireless ear buds and wasn't a fan of the fit for most (one bud would fit while the other falls out). These fit great and with the different included tips, you can swap out and customize your fit for both buds or a single bud [if your ear canals differ in size like mine do].

Sound is good. I'm still trying to find my happy place with adjusting my EQ app on the phone to balance the sound on this pair. Bass is great, mids and highs are crisp. Initially, these seem to be on the quiet side, but with that said, I haven't balanced out my personal sound profile on my phone.

When I saw photos of this product in the reviews here [on Amazon], I wasn't impressed because it looked like cheap plastic. On top of that, it's a brand I never heard of. I found out they are far more superior in quality in person. They just don't photograph well. The case is hefty. It's very solid, well protected with a magnetized clamshell lid. It's not going shatter if you drop it. The exterior of the case has a rubberized coating. This was not mentioned in other peer reviews. To me, that impressed me. It means they designed it to provide extra grip versus the slick or cheaper matte finishes. This will also hide fingerprints, too. The buds are plastic, however they are of a higher quality material with no loose parts or gaps in the ear bud cases themselves. The packaging presentation is on par with a higher end product. This isn't something seen at a $31 price point (as of this writing). The closest you could get to these may be the JLab Go Air, but those don't have an enclosed case nor does it offer WIRELESS CHARGING. Yes, if you have a wireless charging pad, then these are the buds to buy. You will be hard pressed to find a pair in this range that offers that.

I will update this review after a few weeks of testing them and getting a better gauge of the battery life. These seem to be on average with other buds in the price range.

UPDATE #1 (4/7/2020): after still having some issues with fit despite trying all the ear tips, I reversed the ear buds. They have a slight angle and for some reason, the left and right earbuds would not totally stay in the corresponding ears they were meant for. Out of frustration this morning, I put them in reversed to see if the right fit the left ear and vice versa with the other ear.

Sure enough, they actually fit better when worn reversed. They stay sealed and do not budge (moving about, talking, yawning, etc). If you are still struggling with the fit, REVERSE THE EAR BUDS (R in left ear, L in right ear). The angle is actually better this way and will lock into you ear better, plus no discomfort. This largely depends on your ear shape, but it's worth a shot.

Now, to proceed with testing these out more comfortably.

5.0 out of 5 stars The BeBen Bluetooth 5.0 earbuds are Spectacular!
Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
LIKE
For starters: I’ve spent “3 times” as much money on earbuds that didn’t sound even “half” as great as the BeBen Bluetooth 5.0. The pairing was the most intuitive and problem free of any earbud I’ve used. I literally took them out of the box and watched them pair up with my Samsung S9+ no muss no fuss. The sound was nothing short of spectacular. Of course all of this is standard fare so I want to briefly point out a few features that stood out in distinction with this unit. I really appreciated the status notification in my S9+ settings that displayed the percentage of earbud charge remaining. In addition, the lights in the circular charge case incrementally lit up along with the light on each of the earbuds that provided clear notification when my buds were fully charged. One of the biggest surprises is that, unlike many other earbuds, you can touch and readjust the BeBens in your ear without disconnecting your tunes or (more importantly) your call. This is a “huge” benefit if you also use your earbuds to chat with co-workers and clients throughout the day. Last but not least is a feature that has never worked before for any earbud I’ve owned. The BeBen bluetooth 5.0 is the very first earbud that’s shaped to actually stay in my ear and not fall out or shift when I turn my head or lean over. That makes all the difference in the world for supreme comfort in listening pleasure!

DISLIKE
I generally wait 30 days before posting a review to make sure I’ve been thorough. A few days ago I noticed the right earbud volume was dramatically lower than the left. I looked up the Amazon support troubleshooting documentation and found a couple of videos and suggestions that failed to resolve the problem. I spoke with Amazon support (who were excellent) and stepped through a number of other procedures (removing then resetting the earbuds etc.) to no avail. It appears to be a defect with pairing that may occur if you only take one earbud out at a time (instead of simultaneously) . I was sent a replacement unit that arrived in 3-4 days and worked perfectly. I noticed the replacement unit came with a USB C charger cable instead of the USB A charger cable from the previous unit (although it’s not clear whether that’s a relevant factor with the malfunction).

My strong recommendation is to buy one of these units for home use and test it out before buying another pair for work. It’s a great product at a very modest and reasonable price!

A few years ago my husband bought me a pair of noise cancelling headphones. They were great for noise cancelling, but the wires constantly got in the way, and the foam ear pads never fit my ears quite right. When the ear pads finally wore out, I took it as a sign to get some wireless ear buds. I couldn't spend a lot of money on them (thanks, pandemic!) but wanted to make sure I got something I felt would actually stay in my ears, provide at least decent sound quality, and had a good battery life. So, I bought these, along with two other wireless ear buds, and did a side by side comparison. While there were positives to the other two I tried (one had a case that could also be used as a charging block for other electronics, and the other was a style more reminiscent of Apple Airpods but in black), the number one thing for me was the way they fit in my ears (I have tiny ears). I have to say, the Beben X8 ear buds fit AMAZING. They have three different sizes of ear caps offered in two different materials so you can personalize the fit to your ears. They fit great out of the box, but I ended up changing to the slightly smaller size cap for a little more comfort. Because they fit so snugly, their noise cancellation is incredible! I was listening to music on a low volume and didn't hear my husband trying to ask me a question--he didn't love that, but I sure did! I also wore them while doing a workout and didn't feel like they were going to fall out once! They're incredibly light weight, and the case, in addition to charging the buds, also has a magnetic closure, so I feel secure that it's not going to open up in my purse. So far the battery life has been great. I charged to 100% (four lights) a few days ago and after using for a few conference calls and to listen to music, it's at 75% (three lights). The pairing process was super easy, though my only complaint is that they will only pair to one device at a time (i.e. I can't have them paired to my iPhone and my Mac at the same time, I have to disconnect from one then re-pair to the other). Otherwise, I really really love these ear buds. The price is right if what you want is a great fitting, easy to use, light weight pair of ear buds. If you're a true audiophile, they may not be up to the quality you require, but for my podcasts and conference calls, they're great!

Just got these. The sound is excellent but more important is the touch control is not fi ger sensitive but the MFB is click controlled, meaning a more disciplined program. So far volume, forward or reverse of songs, pause and calls work flawlessly. These are the best inexpensive buds I ever owned. The pairing,connectivity and charging is perfect.

5.0 out of 5 stars Great set of wireless earbuds for a very affordable price.
Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2020

As someone who buys phones largely based on whether they still have a headphone jack (an increasingly uncommon feature), it takes a lot for me to be willing to pick up a pair of wireless earbuds—especially given how insanely expensive most of them are. I've owned Xiaomi AirDots and Redmi AirDots (Xiaomi's are comparably priced; Redmi's are around $25). By comparison, the Beben Earbuds are noticeably better. My review will make some comparisons.

Pros:
–Sound quality is solid. It gets pretty loud if you need it to be, and it sounds great whether listening to audiobooks or to music.
–Waterproof!! They advertise it as being good for taking showers, which I can't do with the Xiaomi or Redmi AirDots. I've tested it out and it's a great feature. The case itself is also said to be waterproof, but I haven't tested that myself. But it's nice to know it's there.
–Great battery life. Because it has Bluetooth 5, it also shows the battery life of the earbuds in your Bluetooth settings. It's rated for 5 hours of playback, but I think that literally means "playback," not just being powered on, because I had them in my ears for over five hours (had them playing continually for about 2) and they were still at 70% when I put them back in the case. So battery life seems quite solid. (By comparison, the Redmi Airdots seem to fizzle out at around 4 hours.)
–It comes with a year warranty which is pretty incredible and a great guarantee for the waterproof rating.
–The multi-colored lights on the earbuds themselves are a nice touch.
–There are a lot of very small but noticeable details that show the quality of the Beben earbuds. The charging case has some haptic feedback when you plug it in to confirm you're charging. The earbuds come with alternate sized tips, and with a little loop string you can attach to the case and put around your wrist. There are 4 indicator lights on the case that show how full its battery is. And the magnetic closing feature is a nice touch.
–Dual use or single bud use works effortlessly. On the Redmi/Xiaomi AirDots, you have to use the right bud as the primary and the left one only works if you have the right one on. With these, you can use either one on its own without any additional need to mess with Bluetooth settings. It's super convenient.

Cons:
–The case itself is a little bulky. It's 2.25 inches in diameter and 1.25 inches thick, so depending on how big your pockets are, it might be a tight squeeze.

Overall: This is a great set of wireless earbuds with a lot of attention to detail and quality—and for what I consider a very affordable price.

I use this product to listen to music, podcast, and audio books. I absolutely love these earbuds. I love that I can take a shower while wearing my earbuds I love that I don't have to worry about if they get wet in the rain walking to and from my car. The ability to use one earbud or two is great for me. The battery life for the Bebens are quite impressive My fiance has a pair of earbuds from a DIFFERENT brand (which is what made me want a pair of wireless earbuds) and his are nice and three times the price of mine but his battery life sucks he can't work a whole 10-12hour shift without his going dead. He can't shower with his and he has to use both earbuds or the right sided earbud which may not seem like a big deal but it's a huge plus to just grab one and go and do crafts with the kids and not worry if I got the right one. His earbuds also have a very short range In distance. He pretty much has to keep his phone on him or what he is listening to will come and go in the earbud.
I'm buying him a pair of Bebens just to have for work because the battery life. Like I said before the ones he has now are way more costly but can't do the same things as mine and I have used his earbuds before mine arrived and there is no difference in sound. I actually prefer my earbuds over his, the Bebens are more comfortable , stay in place better, has a longer distance in range so I can leave my phone on the deck and wash my car and not lose sound.
I also haven't had one problem with talking on the phone while using my earbuds both parties can hear great. The only thing I wish Bebens had where color options. Other then that I'm very pleased with my earbuds and will be a company I follow and if I ever need new earbuds this company will be my first stop. I have learned two things. One wireless earbuds are a must have and just because something is more expensive doesn't mean they are going to work any better then something half the price and it doesn't make them any fancier just because they were more money. Mine were half the price of his and all around work better and has better perks then his.
I can't wait for the other ones I ordered to get here. I couldn't help myself I had to buy him a pair,my twin,and my daughter a pair

5.0 out of 5 stars CHANGED PRODUCT

**EDIT: this listing has completely changed from what it was when I bought it. The original headphones were not airpod ripoffs, they were a genuine great product that I was paid to review, just for them to change the product to rip off apple and you.**

**I received this product for free. This offer is no longer available for amazon customers. **

I have been using airpods for about a year now and love the convenience that they bring. However, my ear shape allows them to fall out when working out, which can be a real problem. In come these headphones.
Pros:
Great sound quality. Definitely better than the airpods as expected since these are in-ear headphones.
Great array of included tips for headphones.
Good battery life with LED's on each bud to show if they are on (these only flash when charging/pairing)
Case battery has 5 LED's to show current charge status. This is a nice welcome feature, as it allows me to quickly see how much charge I have at the beginning of the day rather than having to keep a pod in the case and open my phone to see the battery life, which is the case for the airpods. The airpods will give me a "almost dead" orange light but that's not as descriptive as these ones.
Noise cancellation is pretty good thanks to the custom fitting of the tips.
PRICE! These things are easily worth the 30 dollars. If I had to guess, I would've put these at a 70-80 price range.

Cons:
cheap and short included USB micro cable. I would have liked to see USB type C.
Case is a little large. I like to keep my airpods in my pocket, but the profile of the case is too big to make it comfortable for keeping in my jeans' pocket. There is an included strap, but I never have been a fan of these solutions.

I seriously recommend these. For the price, I was concerned they would be cheap, but I would have rather had these than spend the money on the airpods. My biggest fear was the lack of convenience that these would bring compared to the apple solution. However, outside of the standard bluetooth pairing, the experience is the same. Apple allows you to just open the case and they connect- these require you to initially set them up through settings. However, once that is done, taking one or both out of the case will instantly sync them up. You can take just one out of the case and use it, which is what I do, and the other will continue charging. Love these and will continue to use them instead of my airpods when working out or working at my desk.

I was really skeptical of the sound quality of these and you never know what you are going to get with some of these less popular branded headphones. I've been waiting for Googles pixel bud 2 to come out, but they are taking forever and I really can't justify the $180 price tag.

With Amazon's return policy, I thought might as well give these a try and my old pairs battery life is deteriorating.

They are delivered and I see that there isn't any winglets for my unusually shaped ears. Most brands fall out of my ears with slight movement. I put them in and I'm worried it would fall out... I start shaking my head like a wet dog and they stayed put. This is great as I'll use these 90% of the time in the gym.

They paired up really simply with my Google Pixel 3 XL phone in seconds and the sound was exceptionally well. If you are looking for a little bit more of a bass heavy headphone, this is it. At max volume, listening to Disclosures Tondo song, they don't distort and the bass is hitting like in my car... Making me want to dance!

I'm using Google play so the EQ is on which puts more bass as my old pair needed it always on.

As for functionality, I was able to figure out the skip buttons quickly (two taps). One tap pauses. I needed to figure out the volume, which is okay, you have to hold down the buttons on either side and it slllooowwwly lowers or increases the volume. I think this will be okay since I can control volume on my phone and watch.

What was a surprise is that Google Assistant worked with three taps on either ear! So if needed, I can control basically anything now with voice.... Though it's still awkward to do so.

I'm not sure how call quality is, but as with many, I don't actually use my headphones to usually talk on as it's just habit to use the actual phone or my cars stereo system.

Wish this had usb-c charging port instead of micro-usb but I'll survive. Happy to not be with dead headphones in the future as I tend to forget to charge all the time.

Well if you are looking for a nice cheap, Google compatible in-ear, earbuds give these a consideration as I'm very happy with my initial reaction with functionality and sound.

5.0 out of 5 stars These affordable earbuds have luxury quality.
Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
I received these earbuds within 2 days and they are as described. For an affordable price, I am very impressed by these earbuds.

Inside the box, you get earbuds, a charging case, charging cable, and different earbud sizes. A cool feature these have is that they stick to the case with magnets (Yeah, b****, magnets) so they cannot fall out of the case.

Once in your ear, they do not feel like they are falling out or that they're hurting your ears. I have had other earbuds that are painful after about an hour.

The range on these earbuds was very good, about 35 feet. That lets me listen to these earbuds away from my phone, in almost every room in my apartment. The sounds on these bad boys was impressive. I have a pair of Hyphen earbuds I got about a year ago, and these are just as clear and loud as those, and do not fall out of my ear (bonus).

The setup was a piece of cake. I didn't do anything except take them out of their case, and search for them from my phone.

The call quality could be slightly better, but these are about as good as you get with an in-ear wireless earbud for call quality. I have not found a pair of wireless earbuds that work amazingly for calls. Even my wired over the ear noise canceling headphones have so so quality for calls. I would give these a definite thumbs up for call quality.

I highly recommend these wireless earbuds for anyone searching for some affordably priced wireless headphones that are as good as the higher priced name brands! I used them on walks/hikes (whatever outdoor activities we can legally do in this Pandemic) and they do what they say they will do.

The only thing I wish these earbuds/case had was if the case could charge wirelessly.

Having my older Hyphen wireless earbuds case charge wirelessly was a benefit, because I don't have a lot of micro usb cables anymore with the new usb c cables on phones and laptops. But that is just nitpicking.

Overall, I am very happy with these Beben earbuds.

Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2020

I was looking for something that didn't look like I had a growth protruding from my ear and had decent sound quality with a bit of noise cancellation and these fit the bill.

The charging situation with these is great. The lanyard allows me to simply connect the charging container to the zipper of my work bag and lets it hang in my bag. Very sturdy charging container. I have zero concerns about it hanging in my back and taking the constant movement. I keep a charging block in my back that I simply connect via USB and charge them like a phone. No need to even move the thing from my bag.

The buds themselves are well constructed and easy to use once you get used to the operation.

Connectivity works great with my Android phone and I haven't had a single problem with them in any way.

Very solid. Sound great. I would certainly buy these again.

I use them mainly for driving to work and back. Sometimes I use them with my Windows 10 desktop but they have the ordinary bluetooth range so I can't really walk around the house with them because the walls will interfere with the signal... but that's an inherent bluetooth limitation.

Battery life is pretty good for my use. I drive about 15-20 minutes one way and I don't need to charge them but maybe once a week. I turn them off when I get to work and when I get home.

They fit snug and do not irritate my typically sensitive ears. Some earbuds, wireless or not, tend to make my inner-ear area sensitive and sore... and these do not do that.

I would recommend these to anyone looking for a decent pair of BT wireless earbuds. In fact I might look for this brand when I search for other audio products. I've never heard of Beben before but I'd buy other products from them if I happen across anything they make when shopping for other items.

They won't necessarily blow you away but they are more impressive than what I thought I was going to get and for that I am grateful.

When I went to look for bluetooth earbuds for my wife and myself, I was going for the name brands (Samsung, etc..) but was reading good and bad reviews. Plus, with the pandemic hit, my pocketbook was a little strapped, so I decided to look at other lower priced models. I came across the Beben bluetooth earbuds here on Amazon and loved the great reviews. I then watched a few unboxing vids about them. It seems that no one really had anything bad to really say about them. So, we ordered two sets. They arrive on time and in great shape. Straight out of the box, they had enough charge to turn on, pair, and play music for me for four hours. The case had about half charge on it so I let it go for five days without charging it, until the battery was depleted. I charged them overnight and by morning I was listening to music, talking on calls, and just enjoying these comfortable earbuds.
The noise cancellation is AMAZING! I have taken to wearing one when I am out and about as I am completely immersed in my own world when they are in and lose track of everything around me because I cannot hear it. The sound quality is amazing! I am not a soundphile, but I do have an ear for music, tuning, and bad tones: these earbuds deliver great close to true sound. Calls on the earbuds are clear as can be! If my wife uses hers while she is at work, I can hear her coworkers whispering from the next room over. She can hear me perfectly. Even my aged parents can hear me when I use them and call them. Overall battery life for me seems to last a good 7 hours. I charge the base maybe once every week and a half. They can be paired to multiple devices, which the wife loves so she can watch videos on her laptop, phone, etc. I am so glad that I made this purchase and would and HAVE recommended these ear buds to all my friends and coworkers.

5.0 out of 5 stars Decent headphones for this price range.
Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
These headphones are worth the money. But I may be getting something for writing this review.

1. Pairing.
Pairing is easy the first time and from there the headphones take care of the rest. When I pull them out of the case they will automatically turn on and pair with the phone. I'll hear "power on" from each headphone and then "primary" from the right and "secondary" from the left followed by "pairing successful" from both.

2. Charging.
Charging is easy with the indicator light but it uses micro-usb which is less than ideal in the current USB-C environment. The headphones are magnetized and have a satisfying snap when you put them into the case. While one is labeled Left and the other is labeled Right, either headphone will fit in either slot. The headphones last an entire day (6ish hours) comfortably without the case. Speaking of the case, it's way too bulky for a pocket (because if the thickness) but will fit easily in a bag.

3. Sounds quality.
Bass is above average for this class of headphones (under$50). Highs are clear but mids are harsh. "Hotel California" (acoustic version) sounds nearly as good as my galaxy buds but "Bohemian Rhapsody" is a struggle with the electric guitar sounding screechy. The theme from Jurassic Park sounds good too.

4. Sound cancellation.
These headphones cancel no sound. Some buds will have some passive sound cancelling from the tips in the ears but these have no such feature. Regardless of headphone tip, you will hear loud sounds over your music which may be good if you're taking these running. Medium to low sounds may be blocked out by your music but not by the headphones themselves

5. Fit
These are really comfortable and come with 6 pairs of tips in various sizes. They are light and you won't feel then even after hours on your ears. They feel snug and don't fall out when after vigorous exercise - jumping and running.

6. Misc.
These are water proof and have lasted through a week of showers no problem. No high end headphone can quite boast that yet. They aren't very stylish but are incredibly functional.

A slight update. After continuing to use these earbuds I can say they work better than I expected. Perhaps the technology has improved. The sound has continued to be great as well as the connectivity. So far they are better than the other earbuds I've had.

I've had many of this type of wireless earplugs. I'm almost always disappointed by very key features - sound quality, wireless connectivity, ease of use. Usually I give them away to friends or my kids...and then they sit in a desk or kitchen drawer for a while. :)

So I think this is the first pair of wireless earbuds that I will keep. They are very easy to pair to my phone. The phone detected them right away. The earbuds notified me they were pairing. That was it. I switched to streaming music on my phone and the sound quality was quite good.

The earbuds were already around 90% charged (that showed up on my phone too) so I could use them for a while right out of the box. The case charges them as well as protects them. The case has an indicator to show how much charge is left within its battery.

As I said, the sound quality was quite good. I used the streaming apps feature for tuning the sound to my ears...it plays tones to identify which frequencies I pick up easily and which I don't. With these earbuds I had a perfect 'hearing test'...I could hear the entire frequency range of tones the tuner played.

The earbuds fit well within my ears. They feel comfortable and actually are kind of easy to forget about. I was walking around listening to music and then my kids started talking to me...I had to pop out an earbud to talk with them.

I haven't had any dropped connection with the earbuds and my phone. With past purchases of wireless earbuds, it was odd that some movement of my head or being a short distance away from my phone caused the connection to drop.

So for now, these feel like a win. I'll keep using them and hopefully they will keep doing well.

I like these ear buds enough I may order a second set. A little more volume from them would be nice, but I'm not complaining.

9/1/21: I ordered a 2nd pair. The microphone didn't survive the laundry with my 1st set, but the earbuds still work great and they weren't considered waterproof.

Overall, I like these earbuds for music, podcasts, YT, movies, calls, etc. They stay my ears well while using for to hear my GPS riding a motorcycle without a helmet. (I know...my point is they stayed in)

The first pair I owned I had to be quiet when on the phone or people would say the noise is very loud with almost anything I did; even shuffling papers. So far the newer set are reportedly better. I prefer the voice from the original set over these, and I can't seem to get the to turn off without returning them to the charger.

Sound: If you get the right ear cushions on you will get a snug fit, solid bass, good high and mid range sound. Too small of cushions and they will sound like dollar store headphones.

Quality: They don't feel super durable, but they're light, which is important and I've sent them flying through the air plenty of times and they hold up. Again my 1st pair sort of survived the laundry and they were considered waterproof.

Functionality: I rarely remember what each button does and sometimes drop calls or advance playlist songs or YT videos. With my first set I could easily turn them off without placing them in the charger. The second pair don't seem to function the same. Also, if you don't turn them off and they're not in your ears you may wonder why your phone has no sound; human error? I don't know. Sometimes the headphones will turn off by themselves if not used for a certain period of time. I haven't noticed enough to be able to identify that duration and I have not read the manual for the second set I purchased. So there's that.

Worth the cost.

I just want to say that I love these headphones. They are very similar to other wireless earbuds but for the price and quality that you get, these are phenomenal.
Included with the headphones is a micro USB charging cable and several replaceable rubber ear pieces that are different sizes for different ear sizes, a charging box and instructions.
Now at first when I was using them I was a little confused. I could not figure out how to charge them because when I put them in the case the lights would not come on to indicate charging. However after reading the instructions for charging I found that there was a pice of plastic over both charging ports. Simple fix!
That being said, I love these headphones I've used them for some days now and the battery life seems to be quite great! Which is even better considering that you can charge them on the go in the charging box. Which has a whole separate battery itself. The sound quality is great too! Very deep and quality bass when listening to music. Also something I noclticed, when listening to podcasts and stuff where it's people talkingthe voice quality sounds amazing which was surprising to me. Also, I use these headphones to workout and not once did they fall out even on more intense bouts of exercise. The fit is perfect for my ears. That being said I think these headphones are great and that's why I give it five stars.
The only complaint that I have, which is me nitpicking, is that the volume buttons are not to my preference. I have another pair of wireless earbuds similar to these and I double click on the left earphone to decrease the volume and double click the right to increase the volume. Now with these headphones you have to hold the respectice buttons while media is playing to turn up and down the volume. Again just a slight nitpick but for me I wish it was a double click to turn down volume. But overall again a great product especially for the price. Love these headphones.

I loved these earbuds for months, and still do! Excellent sound quality, easy connection, just wonderful! I loved them so much I bought my boyfriend a pair immediately, and boy have they been helpful as we both worked from home during the pandemic! The charging case is brilliant, and I love how they turn on/off automatically when you take them out or put them in the case. I bought them for running, and they were excellent! I wear them frequently with a mask and they don’t feel uncomfortable at all, nor do they fall out when taking on/off the mask.

My reason for 3 stars though..... the battery life was previously amazing, I felt like I could use these for so long and they wouldn’t die! The charging case was awesome too as I stated above. However, after using them for about 2 months, the charging case stopped charging them. Sometimes I’d plug them into the PLUGGED IN fully charged case, and they still wouldn’t charge. I’d find out randomly that my earbuds were on (and using charge) in the case, therefore making my phone only play sound through Bluetooth. This is when I manually turned them off before plugging them in as well. Just super annoying, and definitely not something I should have to replace two months later. I contacted the company and after several messages that were difficult to understand, they agreed to send me replacements. If I receive a replacement and the charging issue was a one time thing, I will definitely edit my review!

*****Edit 8/8/20.... I received my replacements in two days! They are EXCELLENT and I was pleased to see they now take a USB-C charger! This means basically nothing to me but my techie boyfriend says it’s a major upgrade 😂 I see no issues with the charging case at all in this new pair so I think my other pair was just a fluke! I’ve used these nearly all day and they’re still going! 👏🏻 Definitely buy these earbuds, one of the best buys of 2020 for me, even with the charging case issue!

This was my first experience with the new wireless earbud trend, and I have to say it definitely impressed. These have great sound for being a fraction of the cost of the more popular devices.

The case they come with is magnetic so they fit flush when not in use and it charged them as well, Because of this I have yet to hear any battery low notifications as all day use either with one in or both has been excellent. Pairing was a snap and was a non issue. The moment you take them out of the case they turn on and place themselves in pairing mode so they only need to be selected in your Bluetooth menu.

After pairing they remember the last device they were connected to without issue. I have tried them out listening to Spotify Stations and also picking some particular tracks on YouTube to test the bass levels and it's been nothing short of impressive especially for the price point. Sharing was easy as well as just handing one over for the other person to listen to.

When using only one it operates just like similar single Bluetooth headsets, when you pick up the other earbud they will both pair to each other with an audible "Primary" "Secondary" and their ready to go. I've used them both in single mode and had no problems with either being the primary. When you are finished using them and place them back in the case they immediately disconnect and start to charge.

They fit in the ear pretty well as I was worried about them falling out and under normal walking even me running across the street there wasn't a feeling of they may fall out. Sitting perfectly against the curve of your inner ear while channeling sound directly is a nice touch. There isn't a preferred bud for left or right so they can be used on either ear and have the same fit.

I can definitely recommend these to anyone looking to get into the wireless earbud trend. They now have become part of my normal daily electronics as I travel. Small enough to fit in the palm of your hand but big sound when it counts.

The sound quality is what stands out to me the most. It's really, really clear. The bass could be a little stronger, but for $30 headphones, these are better overall than any I've gotten before ... and also the cheapest Bluetooth headphones I've bought.

I have always had trouble with earbuds staying in my ears, but with the shape of the body of each earbud, these stays in snug. I can even go running with these and they stay snug right behind the antitragus of my ear. To be honest, I avoided wireless earbuds for awhile due to the liability of them popping out and getting lost (i.e. over a storm drain on the street or into the door crease in an elevator), but my worries have been quelled with how these fit. While on the point of "fit," they also come with 4 different rubber earpiece sizes, which is the most I've ever received with any earbuds I've bought. That's awesome.

Water proof/resistance is a huge plus, although I haven't hard tested them that way, it's nice to know if they catch a splash, they should be fine.

The signal range seems to come in a little short ... somewhere around 25 ft., but that's also not a huge issue for me as I'm not usually running around a latge warehouse or something without my phone.

The battery case is my 2nd favorite feature next to sound quality. That is a huge convenience. My last pair of Bluetooth headphones were $40, have poorer sound quality and no battery case, although their range was around 40 ft.

My 3rd favorite feature is that you can use just 1 earbud if you want, effectively doubling the advertised battery life of the set (6h earbuds + 24h case = 30 total. Both earbuds have a microphone, so if you're doing a lot of talking on the phone with them and don't need the stereo sound, you're going to be good for a long time.

Bluetooth pairing was also really simple and quick and flawless.

I recommend these headphones for sure. In fact I'm going to tell a lot of my friends about them.

*I received a complimentary set of earbuds for review*

At first listen, I was fully prepared to submit a very unfavorable review on these earbuds. They sounded horrible (over-emphasized highs and very little bass), and they would NOT stay in my ears. I was searching for positive things to say about them just to soften the blow. BUT...

...then I realized that it wasn’t the fault of the earbuds. Operator error was the culprit! It turns out that all I needed to do was to make sure to properly insert the earbuds, with the body oriented up, not down. It made all the difference in the world. Now I hear much more balanced sound, and the earbuds are safely nestled in my ears. The question now is whether you will trust the rest of my review, since I am clearly a dolt.

I’ve used these for several days now, just to be sure of how I feel about them. The packaging was good (although the packing consisted of putting the nicely done product box into a much larger box with nothing done to ensure that it didn’t bounce around in transit). The charging/carry case is nice, and the ‘buds charged with no issue. Pairing was simple, the way pairing should be, but so often isn’t. I have not had a single instance of my audio cutting out.

Directions aren’t the best - as you can see even from the description and details provided by the vendor here on the product page, they could stand a little more work on their translation capabilities.

Back to the sound. I’ve given them 4 stars. Do they compare with my personal wired earbuds, or with my wired or wireless headphones? Well, no. But then, would I really expect these very inexpensive earbuds to be able to compete with something costing 5 to 10 times more? For the price, the sound is pretty damn good. Plus, I can use these in the shower with no issues whatsoever. I can’t say that about any of my other earbuds or headphones.

For the money, these are going to be tough to beat. Easy to use, very functional and decent sound.

Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
I got these as a pair of headphones to use in the gym and as general around-town beaters. Shipping was overnight (hooray Amazon Prime!). The packaging felt very solid, everything was secure and in great shape. A charging/storage case was provided, along with a carrying strap. Additionally, a nice array of high-quality tips were provided, making it easy to find a size/shape that fit my ears. The case is high quality with a nice weight, lid closure is magnetic and the earbuds slide easily into place and are secured by magents. A charging cable is provided (although you have to provide your own wall-adapter if desired). Documentation/instructions are present and clear although some of the syntax/English is not perfect.

Initial impression of the build quality is high - the earbuds feel solid, yet light. They each have a single button on them that has a variety of context-aware functions, although it is a bit off that you have to use one headphone to go to the next track and the other to go backwards.

First thing I noticed while listening to them is how bass-forward they are. They provided a surprisingly defined and present low-end that I did not expect from their size and price-point. This does come at the cost of mid-range definition (I found the mids to be somewhat suppressed / muddied) and some high-end harshness.

Overall some of the things that I liked: the price, the amount/quality of the low end, variety of accessories, pairing was easy, earbuds turn on/off when taken out/put into the charging case.

Some of the things I didn't like: Physical buttons (compared to touch-interfaces present on other higher-end headphones like Galaxy Buds) meant that to change tracks I was jamming the earbuds into my ears, the oddly loud voice instructions / notifications that are built in.

These earbuds surprised me at their price of ~$30. I think that they are a great product for people looking for water-resistant earbuds for the gym that will pump out some good motivational soundtracks. They don't stand up to some of their more-expensive competition in terms of sound quality, user-interaction, and comfort but they do great for the price

5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Call Quality
Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2020

I decided on these Beben x8 for my first pair of wireless earbuds after reading numerous reviews and comments about call quality and price for different brands of earbuds in all price ranges.

Straight from the case, these earbuds easily paired to my Samsung Galaxy s9, and automatically connect whenever I remove one or both earbuds from the charging case. The Beben x8 wireless earbuds looked a little big when I first removed them from the case, but after turning/adjusting/fitting each earbud with the proper-fitting ear cover (I took the time and tried each set), each earbud cradles comfortably in my ear and stays in place even during hour-long phone calls and does not move around when I talk. I found that if the earbud does not have a good seal in your ear and feels too loose, music will sound tinny. With the right-fitting ear covers, these earbuds can block out tv noise in the same room, and music is rich and full. They sound great!

The voice assistant is easily activated with three taps on the earbud, and the call is ended with one tap. Both earbuds have mics so I can use either one for phone calls. I prefer to use one earbud when I’m on a phone call so that I can hear myself speak and not talk too loudly. The person on the other end states I sound clear and cannot tell that I am using an earbud.

I’ve had these Beben x8 wireless earbuds for 3 weeks now and I am very satisfied with this purchase—no wires hanging from my phone or getting tangled up, they look great, they’re comfortable, they’re easy to pair and use, excellent call quality, clarity of sound, good battery life, and a great price. Beben Customer Service provides a free 12-month warranty, which can be requested on Beben Gift on Facebook.

These Beben x8 wireless earbuds are a great product at a great price with excellent call quality, and are just what I was looking for! Highly recommended.

5.0 out of 5 stars Solid bang for buck!
Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
First, let's look at the price. In a world of "you get what you pay for," these ignore that completely. These could easily sell for a bit more. I bought these on impulse and am not reviewing from an "audiophile" standpoint, but from the "I want music when I hit the treadmill, walk my dog, or go skiing" standpoint. So far, so good.

I've had these headphones for 3 full days and have put them through some paces. Podcasts, phone calls, music - while exercising, walking my dog, or driving (one ear for phone calls). The earbuds came with a number of different sizes of adapters; I have abnormally large ear canals and they fit awesomely. I can't wear Apple Airpods or the headphones that come with Apple devices as they fall right out.

I have three tiny complaints that I would consider more "imperfections" than I would problems:

1. The seal is SO GOOD when they're connected, that even when the music is paused, I can hardly hear my surroundings. I need to take one out to talk to people or to be aware of traffic when I'm out on the street.

2. Despite that seal being great, the "angle" of the earbud is tough to determine when they're in my ears. That said, once I get them in, they don't really move.

3. I didn't read the directions, so it's my fault in part that I went to use them and one of the earbuds died on me. Turns out that when I put them in the charging case, I need to pop the button on each of them to charge. Lesson learned, for sure, but it's one of those things that, to me, should just be that it charges when you put it in the case.

Sound quality isn't bad! I was nervous when the "pairing" dialogue wasn't in time, but the music and spoken word worked marvelously. I listened to songs that had heavy panning and each ear delivered sound in a percieveably well-balanced manner. The standard EQ isn't too bass-heavy.

tl;dr: Great headphones for the money. The only problems aren't really problems.

Honestly, this product surprised me. It did everything that was advertised and it did it well. Here are my comments:

- the product box and earbuds case are both very sleek and efficiently take up little room, allowing for easy transport
- the sound quality, which I found to be crisp and excellent, is better than most earbud brands out there
- the user experience I had when it came to setting up my earbuds and learning its features was very good, and although some things aren't outlined in the instructions (such as how to answer and hang up phone calls), I quickly learned the skills
- although it took some fidgeting to try to find the best fit for my ears, when I did finally find it they fit incredibly
- just as advertised, the earbuds are waterproof (I fully submerged mine in water and the sound quality was still great
- the price was incredible, and although I did get a 20% off coupon (leading me to pay only $31.19), the $39.99 price definitely still seems worth it
- lastly, the buttons that control the earbuds are very

There were only three things that bothered me. First of all, the right earbud lowers the volume whilst the left earbuds raises it. I'm used to it being the other way around, but that's a personal preference. Second, raising/lowering the volume takes up quite a bit of time due to the fact that you have to hold down the button for about three seconds just to raise/lower the volume once. Lastly, the earbuds don't really fit too well, and running can cause them to fall off even on the largest setting. If you don't plan on moving too much with them, then these should work just fine fr you, otherwise I recommend looking for another pair.

Here is my overall rating:

User Experience: 4.5/5
- Although the experience was very smooth, I would change a few things here and there, including adding more instruction to the instruction manual.

Sound Quality: 5/5
- Honestly, the sound is incredible, and if I hadn't been told that I was wearing an earbud (and if I couldn't feel the earbud) then I would definitely think that sound was coming from a professional grade speaker.

Comfortableness: 4/5
- Yes, the earbuds are extremely comfortable, but I feel like some tweaks could be made here and there that would truly maximize the comfortableness.

Fit: 2/5
- The fit is truly the worst part about this product. If you stay still then the earbuds will stay on, but the moment you begin to move (such as run, swim, or just walk) they will most likely fall out, even on the largest ear piece.

Price: 4/5
- Please don't be alarmed by the rating on this category, the price is still amazing, but I believe that the best price is around $25.00 - $30.00.

Total: 3.9/5
- Overall, this product is amazing and, in my opinion, worth every penny, unless you need ear buds that will stay on whilst running or doing some other form of activity that requires movement.

They won’t stay in during sport activities but you can ask it all for that price .
The marking of Left and Right will wear out very quick so gotta make sure you put them in correctly.

I almost NEVER leave product reviews but honestly I am very pleased with this purchase and wanted to make sure that the seller knows and potential buyers can be aware too! I decided to buy these after a lot of research since I was looking for something of decent quality yet affordable. These earbuds had a lot of really positive reviews (which always makes me a little nervous to be honest because I don't know if they are compensated reviews). I'm really glad I decided to get them and so far they certainly live up to the hype!

The packaging was solid and not too over the top. (It's annoying when manufacturers put their product in huge packaging that requires a ton of work to open up.) This was neatly packaged in a really efficient way. Instructions were simple and straight forward, although if you've ever paired wireless products before you really shouldn't need too much assistance because it's a pretty universal process.

They paired up with my phone very easily and just like everyone else stated in the reviews, I was impressed because they came with a full charge and were pretty much ready to go after removing the plastic protection. I was even more impressed with the sound quality for the price and grateful to have found something that offers smaller ear pieces as I have small ear canals. I called my partner right away to to test out the mic quality and he said he could hear me just fine. (I called from a quiet room and used a regular volume. I'm sure if I'm out and about the mic 'may' pick up some more background noise, but that's okay as I plan on using this mostly for music and gaming.) I'm happy about the fact that you can take one earbud out and it easily switches to just mono speaker.

Overall I'm really jazzed about these and even though I just got them, I have a good feeling. Will update if anything changes, but so far so good!!

IF YOU READ NOTHING ELSE: don’t forget to remove the plastic strip covering the charging port on each earbud. I'm guessing they need it for shipping but it has to be removed, otherwise the earbuds won’t charge.

The first thing you’ll notice when you unbox these earbuds is the smart packaging. The case has a loop for connecting a carrying strap. It’s a small thing, but it shows the care that went into designing the overall product.

Next was the wide variety of ear tips. The earbuds come with the medium tip pre-installed, but there are also large and small with the black/red design, plus three smaller sizes also included. Once you find the right size, the earbuds fit very nicely and feel great.

Of course the proof of the pudding, in this case, is the listening. How long do the batteries hold up? On my first test, the left earbud lasted 5 hours 21 minutes, the right earbud lasted 5 hours 42 minutes. On my second test, both earbuds lasted for more than six hours. That’s a lot of music! All the while, the sound quality was excellent. And because the earbuds fit so well, there was no outside noise competing with the music.

Finally it was time for a microphone test. I made a call and my testing partner was able to hear me loud and clear.

Another really smart design feature is that the two earbuds are the same shape. If you want to double your battery life, you can use one earbud at a time, and it’s nice if you can choose either one to place in your left ear or your right ear, and not feel “wrong” (like putting your right show on your left foot) - of course this means that when you’re using both earbuds, you might want to know which is which. There is an L or R inscribed on each earbud between the charging port and the ear tip.

I’m loving these earbuds - so glad I found them!

Purchased as a different style earbud, have an air-pod knock-off style and was just not impressed with the fit and sound was just OK. Shipping was right on time as a prime member with accepted Covid delays. First thing I noticed when unboxing was how rugged the bbx itself was, thought to myself this is a good sign. The carrier case is just as rugged, crush proof and has a solid magnetic closure. Plugged the unit in to charge after taking off the plastic separator on the earbud charging contacts. The indicator LEDs are very nice, did not have that with the last set. The pod case has 4 indicator LEDs that flash with different notifications, you can see the charge status as well.

Once everything was ready to go, making the Bluetooth connection was easy. My phone found the device instantly and the LED indicators on the earbuds flashed blue/white as it was pairing. There is also a voice notification that you can hear when turning on/off or when connecting. I kept the instructions handy as it has a complete list of commands that involves clicking the respective buttons on each earbud. That is a real plus for me as my other set involved tapping in different locations. Once I had Spotify up and running I really was not prepared for how great these sound, unbelievable! The bass is incredible and the sound is really rich. Clicking the buttons to skip songs and turn volume up/down worked well. They seal very well in the ear and completely block out any outside noise, I can't wait to use these to mow lawn! I used them for a couple of hours at a time but have not run them long enough at a time to drain the batteries yet so I can't comment on how long they actually last. Very impressed so far, now to order a set for the wife.

I like the presentation as you can see from the pictures and contents: warranty card, easy to follow directions in a foldout pamphlet, usb cable for charging and 4 sets of padded ear piece covers to fit every ear size along with the earbuds which came 3/4 charged. I used a different usb cable that was 3 feet long to charge to full charge. The wireless earbuds were charged to full within 1 hr. You have to for sure read the directions to know to take off the tiny tiny plastic cover over the charging pins on the earpiece to be able to pair to your device. Easily paired with iphone 8plus. The sound is better than another pair I already own. The sound is clear. I walked away from my device up to 30 feet without any interference or drop of quality in sound from my device. I was listening to a movie while I work remote and walked away to put something up in a closet. I have had them on now for 6 hours and still going strong on battery life. the directions say 5 hours of listening time and 70 hours of standby time. I keep waiting to hear the power low notification. The earbuds are very comfortable I tried both and then I went with just one so I can hear for other sounds in the house. The earbuds fit solid in my tiny ear canal and seals out noises around me. The quality of the sound is pretty incredible for $30 wireless earbuds. They also have a couple of iOS only directions to access siri which my others do not have this feature. Buy these I know you will not be disappointed in the quality of these bluetooth wireless earbuds. They are also waterproof so you could listen to tunes or the news in the shower. You can't dive with them though besides I don't know why you would want to wear them while diving. Great distance of at least 25-30 feet without dropping the quality of sound or disconnecting.

I got this precisely for one thing - wearing them in the shower. I wasn't expecting much otherwise. However I'm pleasantly surprised. Context - I have a bunch of budget wired chi-fi iems, over ear planars, the excellent Tin Hifi P1 and a few other premium iems with amps and dacs. So I like great sound but I'm not over analytical.

While these are no audiophile buds, I was impressed by the first listen. Not broken in yet so these are first impressions. There's not much low bass, mid bass is quite boosted, vocals are forward, treble is airy and not sibilant or painful. It's not natural but it all comes together quite well, considering it's price. It doesn't suffer the budget bane of being tinny, shrill or a muddy bass or mid-range. I guess it's the kind of sound I would want when exercising or in the shower, with some punch and clarity. This is something I could listen to comfortably. Classical music seems to sound quite good. Sound wise I would guess that they cost $60 in a blind test, and that's compared to wired iems. But this is my first truly wireless.

In the shower it works well so far, the physical buttons avoid the capacitive touch nonsense that activates randomly with water droplets. Phone was about 15 feet away with a wall in between, no signal drops.

Overall I'm more than pleased with these, if you can get past the somewhat dated design of the buttons, but unavoidable for shower use. The case is nice and compact, I hope the hinge doesn't tear over time. The buds go in with a nice solid pull and you can use either bud independently. I'm not rating them for phone calls or battery life as it wasn't important to me.

BTW, being able to listen to my fav music in the shower privately (without disturbing others) totally rocks. Would totally buy again.

These headphones are great for listening, but recommend you look elsewhere if you plan to use them for phonecalls.

I'm not an audio expert and may not be the best at detecting audio details, but I compared them to two other headphones I've used and they seem comparable. The volume is really good, surprised by how loud they can get. Bass seems strong too.

The fit was good once I changed the tips to the smaller/narrower version that allowed the earbud to fit deeper into my ear. They stuck out a bit too much before making that change but they're surprisingly snug after changing the tips.

That snug fit means they don't really budge much when I press the buttons. I think they fit deep enough that when I press the buttons, the upper portion of the bud rests against the outer hollowed part of my ear so my ear canal doesn't get the brunt of the pressure. They stay very secure while running too.

There's no active noise cancellation but the snug fit naturally does a good job at blocking out noise.

Don't plan on using these regularly for phone calls. Great for listening, but the other person won't be able to hear you well. Mic is terrible.

The connection seems to be very strong. I walk by a spot that apparently has a lot of signal noise and it ALWAYS caused my last headphones to lag/jump. Testing these new ones twice, there have been no lags/jump when walking by that same spot.

Just like all other headphones I've had, the battery percentage shows in 10% increments on my Pixel so you won't see the exact battery percentage. I believe this is an Android thing with any headphones (other than Pixel buds I imagine).

I was impressed by how small the buds and the case actually are. Really compact.

I haven't tested other true-wireless ear buds but these seem to be great, especially for the price.

Will update if battery, or other, issues start to arise.

Pairing was instantaneous. Wearing it is very comfortable. Better than any earbuds I have had, cheaper or much more expensive. The fit is snug enough that I do not believe it has any likelihood of falling off. As I have just had them, I cannot comment on how long the batteries are going to last one charge. There is no statement in the manual as to how long it is expected to last. The bass is significant for something this size.
They aren't noise canceling. However, they basically cut off all external sound. Dont planning on carrying out a conversation why you are wearing these and listeing to something..
Very pleased.
UPDATE
In these days of COVID I had to record a presentation for a conference talk, that will be broadcast virtually. The microphone on my Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Yoga 3rd gen proved to be terrible. After I tried all the accessible mikes, I found these head phones, in the phone mode, lying on either side of the laptop produced by far the best results. I was overjoyed. I recommended it to my work, they bought a couple of pairs and two colleagues bought them as well and are very happy. Unfortunately I have no idea where I put the pair after that recording session, I never could find it again. So I cursed but almost immediately, on August 18, ordered another pair.
All was good in heaven but not quite 6weeks or so later, as I picked the pair out of the charger, one was rather hot and the light wont come on and it wont work. After some more trying I contacted "Beben Gift" through their facebook page - they asked me to send a video demonstrating it wasnt charging and I did. They assured me that this must be extraordinarily rare but they will replace it. Today I received the replacement, a whole new package. Really customer service has been extraordinary. I appreciate these guys!

I was skeptical purchasing these at first. But I have to say these tiny earbuds have SUPERB sound quality. Not only do they both work simultaneously for Media, Music and Phone Calls but they can be used one at a time (independently) also which is nice for using as a Bluetooth headset for phone calls. Phone calls are CRYSTAL clear on both ends. They have an extremely low profile and do not look all big and bulky in the ear which was a huge plus as well ... Another cool thing is that they seem to fit and seal inside the ear perfectly cancelling all outside noise. It literally feels like you are in your own little world!!! Pairing literally is instant and no hassle ! The charger is also pretty nice ... Its a rubber coated round tiny charger / case wich is water resistant and TINY and doubles as a keychain =D !!! It can be charged with any MICRO USB charger which is also awesome, eliminating the need to carry an extra charger or special adapter etc. I have indeed purchased other sets for more money as well as a few others in the same price point and these are by far my favorite set now . I have literally never had a set that exceeded my expectations like these have . Perfect sealed fit, low profile, superb sound , great bass, noise canceling, crystal clear and a nice little charger as well ... NOw this leads to my last point and a really important one ... Customer service was AWESOME .. In fact I was greeted with an awesome little surprise card in the box that instructed me to contact them VIA email or facebook page to register my warranty and they actually issued me a gift card for my choice of Amazon or PayPal!!! Very cool company!!! They have my future business !!! I am going to be ordering 2 more sets !!

I ordered these primarily to use for workouts and to listen to music while studying. I had been looking into getting some quality true wireless earbuds for a while, but quite honestly I did not want to make the investment in AirPods. I think AirPods are all hype, especially after trying these earbuds out.

Pros:
- The sound quality was amazing and I was extremely impressed by the bass quality on these things. I listen to a wide variety of music genres but I am definitely a fan of songs with some bass in it, and these allowed me to enjoy such songs. I did not experience this with the AirPods
- The charging case and the earbuds themselves are super sleek. The earbuds magnetically connect to the charging case and the charging case also closes magnetically
- I was also surprised with how well a job these did with noise cancelling. I couldn't hear anybody talking to me while I had them in
- Pairing was super simple initially and now they connect automatically once I take them out of the case and automatically turn off once I replace them back in the case
- Siri and other command functions are very convenient

Cons:
- I was surprised with the fact there were command functions on these earbuds but I couldn't imagine someone who had hands any bit bigger than I did being able to use the tiny buttons with ease
- Talking on the phone I could hear the other person OK but my voice sounded mumbled

All in all these are an amazing alternative to AirPods for someone who wants totally wireless earbuds that are good quality, without the expense of AirPods. The only thing missing that the Airpods have are the little image that pops up on your device when pairing and they automatically pause when you take them out of your ear. If you can live without that and are just looking for quality wireless earbuds then these are for you!

All I can say, is you need to get these headphones! The quality of the design, fit, and sound is impressive.
I am always looking for the *perfect* pair of headphones that fit in my ears well, aren’t heavy, and don’t fall out after considerable wear throughout a day. I do a lot of talking throughout the day for work as well as use them for yard work on the weekends. Every pair of headphones I seem to purchase only fits well for a short period of time and ends up falling out after talking for only 30 minutes. Enter the Beben X8 headphones!
The box comes with SIX sets of earbud tips that are sure to conform to your personal ear. This seems to always be my problem, but it’s not an issue with these headphones. In addition, the packaging contains the headphone, the charging/carry case, a (short) MicroUSB cable, and a lanyard attachment for your charging/carrying case. It is a nice compact design for easy transport or storage.

The pairing process is easy, but you first need to PULL OFF THE PLASTIC on the underside of each earbud that protects it from the charging pins in the case. Before you charge the units or use them, make sure to do this so you aren’t frustrated after you realize it “isn’t charging.”

The sound quality is superb. The deep bass and clear audio are great for nearly any music type. Adjusting the volume is a breeze, simply hold down on the left to adjust the volume down and hold down the button on the right bud to increase the volume. Want to go back to the previous song? Just double-tap the right earbud. If you want to forward it to the next song, double-tap the left earbud. Want to access your preferred Assistant? Just triple-tap the left earbud.

I consider myself an audiophile; I love immersive music of all kinds - jazz, classical, EDM, hip-hop, R & B, rock... and, yes, even a little bit of county. I love hearing the sound of fingers sliding across strings, of a breath being taken before the passing of a bow on the violin, the grunts and groans of an instrumentalist in the groove. THESE HEADPHONES PUT ME THERE! They ABSOLUTELY deliver on sound quality and sound isolation. The lows are low; The highs are high and crisp.

I was highly impressed from the moment I received them in the mail. From the outer packaging, to the top-to-bottom foam insulated box, one thing you'll notice about these headphones is the great attention to detail. Even the rubber caps are 'high-quality' in build, yet very appealing to the eye. They feel durable - not like other rubber caps that feel like they're made from cheap plastics. The units as a whole fit very snugly, yet comfortably in my ears. I put the 'waterproof' claim to the test and took a shower with them, while listening to one of my favorite jazz tunes - flawless. I was expecting some type of distortion or interference from the water, but amazingly, these phones are designed in such a way that the water channels through without disrupting the vibes.
I tried some vigorous workouts with them as well. Again, the design keeps the phones in place, so much so that you almost forget they're in your ear... unless someone tries to talk to you or get your attention.
After having used these headphones, I would gladly pay even more than they are priced - they're that good. They're easily worth $40 ($20 a bud). But at 30 bucks ($15 a bud), you can't go wrong - worth every penny.
I'll be retiring my previous MIFA bluetooth headphones to the 'back up bench' (which I paid the same price for, I might add). The BEBEN headphones are now my new favorite.

1. Shape and Fit: 4.5 out of 5 stars
Who cares if a set of earbuds sound phenomenal but you can't stand to have them in your ears??? These come with a variety of rubber covers to make as comfortable a fit as possible, and the buds themselves are a kind of tear-drop shape that you can twist to sit in whatever direction needed. They are a tiny bit bulky if you're using them at night while you're trying to fall asleep but they are WAY Better than even the smaller, elbow shaped buds I've used before. They can sit snug but even so, they can still fall out of your ear eventually with a lot of movement, so I have to readjust regularly while working out. Seems to be the bane of all buds, though...

2. Sound: 5+ stars
Crisp, clear, balanced, with good output for even those bad recordings. Call quality = excellent, and never had a problem with anyone hearing or understanding me, either. Perfect for music during my workouts and great for audio books!

3. Features: 5 stars
* Use one or both - love this!
* Crazy great range - I still get a connection outside, 50 feet from the house where I've forgotten my phone. :)
* Excellent battery life! I've listened all night! And the case as a power bank make these go for days!
* One tap to pause, answer, or hang up. Hold to power up or down (though they automatically do so when you take them out of or put them back into their case, respectively) and to adjust volume.

4. Bonus: No loud, obnoxious notifications indicating battery is low or that you need to charge. And great price! Best pair of buds I've owned.

Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2020

I’ve been using my wireless earbuds for the past couple of days and love them!

Comfort/Fit: The earbuds are very cozy and sometimes I forget they are in. It took a couple of times testing out the different sizes of earbud caps to find the perfect fit. They provide you with many different cap sizes which is great.

Bluetooth Distance: The distance you can travel away from your phone is great. I don’t have an exact measurement but I’ve tried them out with chores around the house and they were able to remain connected to my phone, even if I left it downstairs and was cleaning the upstairs. I would estimate their range from my phone is more like 20-30 feet, possibly a little further.

Sound Quality/Noise Cancelling: I think the sound quality is great. The noise-canceling is almost too good. If I have my volume on low, it seems to cancel out most of the noise and I usually need to pause the sound or take one earbud out to hear the person.

Battery life: I charged the battery on the day I received it and it had lasted me for the past 3 days. I’ve probably used it for about 4-5 hours total and the charging case is only down to 2/4 bars.

Setup ease: I had some difficulty where only one earbud connected originally. This was not a big problem because they provide step by step instructions in case this happens. It was easy to resolve and I was all set up in about 5 minutes with no further connectivity issues.

Additional Thoughts: I wanted to test these out during a workout and found that they stayed in my ears. A few times they felt a little loose, but they never fell out through jump squats or planking.

This is my first foray into true wireless buds. I was never interested because I assumed they would fall out, and did not want to waste a large amount of money on something I would lose, or in the case of ear pods, would suffer a short life due to battery decline.
The price of this set was right. It had many good reviews (more about that in a moment) so I decided to try them. I happy I did.
Excellent sound quality. Noise cancellation seems to be for real. Battery so far has exceeded expectations. I like the compact charging case. It is nice because the case itself can hold a charge and charge the buds even if the case is not plugged in.
When paired with my phone, the buds kept a rock solid connection, even when I was downstairs and pods were upstairs.
They stay in with no issue and come with 6 different tip sizes. I use the smallest ones for sleeping, and the buds are comfortable enough to fall asleep in.
I did not love the connection I achieved with my Apple Watch. I went for a run, and I could not hold a good, consistent connection. I wear my watch on my left wrist. Not sure if that matters.
A card in the package offers a free one year warranty to those who provide feed back on the purchase and, if they can, leave a five star review on Amazon. So that might explain the number of five star reviews. I give it five stars despite my issues with maintaining a connection to my watch on a run because I think these buds offer a tremendous value, and I have no intention to use them for running anyway. Mind you, they stayed perfectly in place on my run. Also deserves five stars for the noise cancelling and sound quality.

I have been using these for a little over a week and I must say that I really like them for the overall sound quality. My job does not allow me to move around a lot so for me the buds stay in perfect place for the day. I did notice that when I run however they feel a bit top heavy and have a tendency to work themselves out of my ear. The case is nice and solid and so are the buds. To me they do not feel cheap even though the price is low. The battery last longer than I thought they would and I only change about every three days and use them about 9 hours a day. Not sure how long that is going to last but I will go the long haul.

The audio quality is better than I expected, noise cancellation is passive however I did find that the jumps in volume are a little more steep than I expected. You have to mess with the up and down volume control to get it dialed in perfect. If the company made a app that allowed for some fine tune adjustments like volume steps and EQ that would be a great plus.

Overall sound is good with little outside interference. With lower volume you can hear cars and some wind noise while out side but one bump up it's completely gone.

The case that charges the buds is good and it does charge fast. Led indicators display battery level and they fit secure for changing. These are awesome buds for the price. The over all quality is very good. I would not suggest these for active distance runners because they have a tendency to loosen but for everyday activity they are a great value.

5.0 out of 5 stars Great budget true wireless Earbuds
Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
I have been looking for a good pair of true wireless earbuds for a few months now, and have tried the most expensive ones available, as well as a lot of budget options. When comparing this to others with the noise isolating earbuds, I was pretty impressed with sound quality. This sounded great when listening to music, books, and even while watching Netflix (some budget options have a lag when watching shows). I would say there wasn't a significant enough difference compared to some more expensive options, but better than some other budget earphones I have tried. Also, the volume was able to go very loud, which combined with the noise isolation, completely blocked out outside noise.

As someone with weird ears, it is always difficult to find some that do not hurt your ears. The first thing you notice is that these are very light, so they are able to stay in very well. I also had them on for an hour and didn't get annoyed with them.

Pairing is pretty easy a quick, as long as you pull out the stickers from the charging pins. A must-have for me is being able to use one earbud at a time if I want, which does allow you to do.

The biggest con for me is the case, as it is a little large and not a USB-C charging port, but I also knew that was the case going in so I was not going to take away a star for this.

Overall, if you are looking for solid true wireless earbuds at a fraction of the premium models, I think this is a solid choice. They are comfortable, block out noise, pair easily, and have good battery life. Again, just be aware the case is a little larger and the charging cord is micro usb rather than a USB-C.

5.0 out of 5 stars Does what it promises and afforable
Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
These earbuds have a lot of features and seem to be of great quality, so at its price point it is a steal.

The Good:
- Affordable compared to other wireless earbud competitors
- I'm no audiophile, but the sound quality is perfectly satisfactory for me
- Raised multi-purpose button on each earbud, allowing a combination of presses for all sorts of instructions (volume control, song selection, power, play/pause, phone calling, etc).
- Range is as advertised. Tested at around 15 feet with no real disruption.
- The charge case is a great inclusion
- Includes 3 different sizes of earbud caps to suit your comfort
- Bluetooth pairing was painless
- Design looks fine

The bad:
- It doesn't "feel" as secure as I would like it to, but in reality it does stayin my ears just fine with movement. I find that the best way to put it in is to twist it into my ear canal, as opposed to trying to push straight in (the pressure wall won't allow it). I think I'll just get used to this.
- The volume controls are slowwww. You have to continue to hold either the left/right earbud button down for a second until it begins to raise/lower the volume slowly in increments, and then you let go when acceptable. You can imagine this is frustratingly longer than having an option that raises/lowers volume with discrete button presses.
- When you perform an action with the earbud buttons, there is a voice that announces your action. WHAT??? So everytime I skip to the next song or go back, I hear this stupid "FORWARD" or "REVERSE". It is absolutely ridiculous and the fact there isn't an option to disable this is even worse. What kind of respectable music player would do this? However, this is fixable with a firmware update so here's hoping they address this in the future.

5.0 out of 5 stars Meets Expectations- of a pair of 30$ wireless waterproof earbuds
Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
I've had them for 2-3 months, and the button on the left earbud stopped working after the first few weeks, but the sound still plays fine in both, so it's not the biggest deal. The only annoying part of that is that I can't power them both on if I don't have the case on hand because, since the left one doesn't respond to the button, it only turns on when taken out of the case because the earbuds are programmed to do that automatically.

Other than that, the sound quality has been fine, the battery life is a little hard to pinpoint, but I can say that they charge very quickly for sure, and plus the case is also a huge battery booster and it's easy to carry around. I have not submerged the earbuds, but they've survived like 70 showers with the only damage being the unresponsive button. I only have one other issue with them, and that's that the earbuds, while not uncomfortable, can be pretty loose. I don't know if it's my ears or how I turn my head, but when I'm in the shower my left ear always fills up with water that gets on the inside of the earbud, and aside from being annoying, ends up with the bud falling out. (I've always caught it when it falls; the damage to the left earbud is not a drop, it is water damage)

Sure, I have two complaints. BUT at this price point (around 30$ when I purchased) it's perfectly fine. I'd rather give four and half stars, and only take off the half-star because of the unresponsive left-earbud, but I can't. If you're looking for the cheapest pair of usable "waterproof" earbuds, these are definitely acceptable- as long as the price stays under 30$

I go to college in Boston, and my campus is about half a mile from where I live so I walk to and from every day and sometimes on weekends for studying. Same for my job; it's right around the corner. Earbuds with wires tend to be too much clutter and tangle easily, so I purchased those primarily for that purpose. And then COVID-19 hit, so now I'm wearing a mask all the time. Wires become even more of a nuisance.

The positive reviews were hyping up the bass of these earbuds, as well as noise cancelling, etc. and I truthfully wasn't expecting any of that to be super good considering the price. I just needed them to walk around the city without wires. But wow!! As soon as I put them in, even without putting music on yet, they were SO noise cancelling. I have a toddler living in my household, and he's in his terrible twos, so I'm constantly hearing screaming. I heard almost nothing!! When I put music on, at 50% volume I could comfortably hear the music with minimal background noise. I also listen to several genres of music (classical, opera, pop, R&B, rock, alternative, some country, etc.), so I tested them out for each. Bass was perfect where there was some, all songs were clear and crisp, and nothing was muffled. Because of this, I also started using them while exercising. I have a running, weight lifting, and yoga regimen and they don't fall out at all. The music is still clear. But like any earbud, your ears get sore a little bit after a while. That's my only complaint though. Battery life is perfect, the case is super durable, and overall very travel friendly. 10/10 recommend!!!

For $30, these are an excellent pair of true wireless earphones.

Pros:
- Price is solid
- Better sound quality than expected. Definitely near the top in quality for this price bracket. Bass heavy but not excessive.
- IP68 means you can shower/bathe with these, as well as light swimming.
(Diving isn't recommended due to the signal being cut off by water)
- Comes with a total of six eartip sizes. I picked the largest for the best isolation/security of fit.

Cons:
- Only passive noise isolation, no active
- Limited button function (holding the Control button increases volume, but you need to use your phone or voice assistant to turn the volume down). Can pause, play, skip/repeat songs, and take/end/reject calls. I usually use buttons primarily for play/pause and for adjusting volume, so this is a con for me.
- Micro USB instead of USB C in 2020

Other observations:
- Charging case is relatively lightweight, and about the size of a mandarin orange
- These are definitely mid-range and bass leaning. The treble isn't terrible, but just a bit understated, especially around the mid-treble area. It'll be up to you if you're fine with this. Practically speaking, it makes these earphones better for hip hop, electronica, etc. Rock/metal sounds okay, but a lot of the guitar and vocals take a step back over bass and drums, unless it's a very high note.
- Soundstage is what you'd expect from $30 earphones, nothing impressive. That's not why you're buying these though, hopefully.

I received this pair for free for an honest review. I've tried multiple earphones in this price range as well as owning and regularly using headphones in the $300+ range, to give you context. I would recommend these to anyone looking for budget true wireless, as long as they're okay with some limited functions.

I wasn't too sure what to expect when I ordered the product ( unfamiliar with the brand and not very expensive); however, I am pleasantly surprised with the headphones.

I've always believed the little things 'set the mood' - the item was well wrapped and the didn't seem cheap thrown together. The rechargeable case seems pretty sturdy/well made, and the earbuds are on the smaller/lighter side for those who don't want the large,bulky earpieces.

Sound quality is pretty respectable - I've tried all kinds of headphone brands and price ranges, and I can say this is a top contender. I listen to a variety of bass-heavy music, and I feel that my expectations have been exceeded. They dont have that cheap/squeaky tune and the sound is very LOUD and FULL. I usually have the volume on max with any other set, but i dont go much past 50% - 60% with these. Noise isolation is pretty significant even at lower volumes. In the office or around the town, I wasn't able to hear anyone or anything else - love it!

The included manual mentions they are water proof and you could swim/ not completely submerge them. Bluetooth pairing was super easy any they work solo/together ( didnt use instructions bc didnt need to) - the voice prompts will tell you when they're paired to the phone, pair to each other, and even which one is primary/secondary. there are additional neat little features built in that the manual will explain.

Overall, I would feel comfortable highly recommending the headphones to family/friends. they come with a warranty and satisfaction guarantee ( box insert) - you really cant go wrong with that!

I bought these because I was looking for a set of earbuds that I could use while swimming and in the hot tub. These work very well for that. They fit my ear snugly (using the appropriately sized ear gels), the sound is great and the battery lasts for longer than I am in the pool or hot tub! I like the feel of a physical button on each ear bud since it makes a positive "click" feel so you know you have pressed the button. I really like the fact that the case has an internal battery that can give me a few full charges of the earbuds without having to recharge the case all the time. I can see that being really useful when I go to the beach and don't have a source of power nearby so that I can listen to music all day.

I wore the earbuds to bed to see how they feel when drifting off to sleep. They feel OK but protrude out of my ear a bit too much so that when I'm laying on my side, there is some pressure on my ear (could just be an issue with the shape of my ear). The other issue I had when trying to use these while going to sleep is that, paired with my iPhone, I can't get the volume down low enough so the minimal volume level is just a bit too loud to comfortably fall asleep to. But since these are not meant for sleeping, this is not a deal breaker for me. For daily use, the volume level and sound quality are great.

Initially, I was slightly skeptical about purchasing these headphones as I did not think (from what I saw online) that they would be able to meet my expectations, but after using them for the past several weeks, I can honestly say that I was wrong. To begin, the design of the case and headphones is nice...it is small, compact, and sleek in design. The wireless buds fit comfortably inside of my ear, and they do not fall out when I am moving quickly or vigorously (e.g. when exercising). They were easy to pair with my iPhone & MacBook, but a few times, they would not disconnect when I put the buds back into the charging case. The sound quality is crisp and on point. I have used the headphones while hosting and participating in various virtual meetings, and there was no lag in sound and everything audio was highly clear.

One of the few things that I wished this set of earbuds had was a digital display of the percentage of the case. It would be nice to see an early one when I need to recharge the case as opposed to waiting for headphones to tell me when they are about to nonfunctional due to low battery. Also, I was not particularly fond of the plastic buckle in the back of the case. I understand that it increases the flexibility of the case and allows one to open the case further, but I do not think that portion is necessary, and honestly, it makes the design of the case slightly less appealing.

Nonetheless, I firmly believe that the pros of these earbuds outweigh its cons. These earbuds are great, and I would recommend you try them out!

If I could give these 10 stars, I would. I don’t usually write many reviews, but when something is this good, I feel that I have to. I was not expecting them to be as good as they are considering the low price. I enjoy listening to music with earphones and, as a result, usually use the Sony WH-1000 xm3 set that I have. Between the noise cancellation and the sound quality of them, they are a fantastic pair of earphones. You are free to not believe me but, I would say that these BEBEN ear buds come surprisingly close to the Sonys…certainly not the same sound quality for sure, but better than any other ear buds I have ever tried. No, I was not compensated by BEBEN nor did I receive anything free from them for saying this. I usually listen to the beginning of ZZ Top’s “Poor Boy” for a test of the bass, and to some triangles in the classical music that I enjoy for the highs. There was plenty of tight bass for the first (certainly not all of it) and the highs were crystal clear for the second. It’s almost like I got a pair of Sennheisers by mistake. It is key, however, to be sure that you put the correct size rubber tips on them so they fit as snugly as possible in your ear to hear the sound at its’ best. They fit my ear very well, they stay in, they charge quickly and they sound great. I don’t know what else I can say other than refer you back to the headline.

Love it! I have several True wireless earbuds in the house including some major name brand that costs couple of hundred bucks but so far this one is my go to pair. My biggest issue I've had in the past with these type earbuds are that they don't stay in the ear for long during an extreme workout. They seem to move around a bit once I sweat during a dynamic workout and would have to keep adjusting them. I can say that this one is different as it fits like a glove and you won't notice them on after couple of minutes you put them on as they're comfortable. The sound is great and volume can go pretty high without sounding horrible. I like that it can be worn on either side. I mean the one that says L fits just the same on R and vise versa. This is perfect for me since I can switch them because I prefer to wear only one while running on the roads on my left ear more than the right. The feature I like is audible notification on these. Comes with 6 sets of earplugs so you can be assure one of them will gives you a right fit. Battery life is impressive. I've had this for about 5 hours non stop on music and about 8 hours on standby mode and so far and haven't had to put back in case to recharge yet.
I prefer the click button type as I don't have to worry about accidental clicks with touch type. Friends say I sound clear when I'm on the phone with them so it's a plus.
Try them on. You'll like it.

When the product arrived, based upon prior reviews the first thing I tried was to charge the system - USB cable for charging was the wrong size for the charging port. It had a standard USB A connection at one end but the end for the charging port was for a different interface. I used a Kindle charger and it seemed to work ok. Sound seems very good for the price. Have not yet tested all the features but it does sync with bluetooth on iPad and iPhone. Have only had it for two days. Update 5/20 was contacted by seller that manufacturer was notified about incorrect charging cable. after using for a few days I am impressed overall (particularly for the price). Seems to be best when listening to music and participating in Zoom calls. Sound over the phone is less quality but that could be from many sources, not just the earbuds. No problems in pairing with iPhone or iPads. Has multiple ear tips so I recommend trying various tips to see how it best stays in the ears.
Update of previous review: This second unit had the updated charging port and correct cable. Really enjoy using these and the great thing is that I can control volume on a pc by using the slider volume control rather than having to press button on earbud. After comparing these airbuds and the apple air bud these are definitely better for control on a PC where apple earpod is pretty much restricted to being able to control only on an IOS product.

5.0 out of 5 stars Nice little wireless earbuds (waterproof!)
Reviewed in the United States on February 29, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
I bought these earbuds with the intention of walking on the treadmill at the gym because I was getting tire of my old wired headphones snagging on everything and getting ripped out of my ear-holes! The first thing I got to appreciate with these earbuds was the quick charging they get when placed in the magnetic holding case. The case plugs into your standard mini USB charging block that you use with your phone. In no time at all they get charged up and last multiple workout sessions before needing to be recharged, which is never a problem as I just keep the charging case plugged in all the time next to my smart watches' charging dock and put them in there when I get home for safe keeping. The sound is actually pretty good for the type of music I listen to when working out (pop and classic rock music) and get as loud as I feel comfortable with. Their wireless range stretches as far as I'd ever need it to go as I'm never more than a few meters from my phone (android). The general quality of these earbuds feels pretty high and they come with multiple rubber ear caps to match the size of ear canals that you have (small/medium/large). The instructions say you can even swim with them since they are waterproof (which I can't wait to do because it will feel so wrong but be so cool to listen to music in the water). I think I want to buy another set of these Benben buds as a gift because I like them so much and can't believe I've gone so long without something like this, and these have gotten me off to a great start!

5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Fit and Quality to Match
Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
I had bought a pair of JVC bluetooth earbuds at a start of the earbud craze about 1.5 years ago. For the $50 price tag, they were nice enough. Sadly, the fit was poor and I dropped one, causing it to break and leaving me with one ear!

Fast forward to 2020, and I've decided to give Beben a try. What a pleasant surprise! The fit is perfect, and I haven't had any retention issues at all. Even if I did, they give you a couple of different rubber pairings that I'm sure will solve your issue.

The battery life has been great. I only use them for 2-3 hour stretches at a time, and they've lasted as long. Like most bluetooth earbuds, Beben gives you a small carrying case that functions as a portable battery for quick recharges when you put them back in the case. The sound quality is superb, and the aesthetic is sleek. Each earbud has a button on the sides that functions as a power button and a pairing button to your bluetooth enabled device. Pairing is seamless and fast, and the buttons work well with the design.

My only issue is that while walking with my phone, the sound has skipped a little bit. I don't know if this was the battery dying, or if the connection was falling out. But the issue hasn't lasted long. I don't run or exercise with the earbuds, so I don't see this being much of an issue in the future.

All in all, these are a 5 star pair of bluetooth earbuds! I am 100% satisfied with the $30 price tag and would recommend these to anyone.

I eager to help you find a good quality item. I came in to buy these with pretty low expectations considering the price range. But I have been very impressed with the quality of them.

These full wireless earbuds have great functionality. The buttons are very intuitive and will automatically connected and disconnect from my device and I open and close the carrying case. The buttons are responsive and work very well. The noise is not incredible, but come on, at this price range you can't expect great noise quality. These are light weight and I have found they fit great in my ears. Don't worry if you have huge ear canals are very small ones, as they come with more sizes then I have ever seen come with ear buds, from giant to tiny. I have not tested them in water, though I am sure they will meet the criteria described in the item summary.

The case is one of my favorite features. It has a really nice feel and does not attract finger prints. It comes with a lanyard which I thought was a very nice touch. This case has lights that show the power level, making it easy to know when they need the be charged again. And, what I think might be the best feature for this case, the type c charging.

My one critique would be that the buttons take quite a bit of pressure the press. This is very nitpicky though, as it is not terrible, just a little inconvenient.

I love the packaging of these headphones, and how it came with a little strap so you can easily carry it around. It also came with like six different tips you an switch out to fit your ear size, which I really appreciated.
The headphones are relatively small and easy to use; if you’re looking for a subtle pair; these are nice.
Pairing with my iPhone was SUPER easy; I didn’t even have to read the directions to have it paired and working!
It also works awesomely with single earbud or with both. I took one off and plugged it in to the charger, and then, as soon as it took it back off and put it on, music played out of both of them. No extra pairing was necessary. This is something I like most about these earphones!
Taking them out of the case and clicking a button connects them, and putting them back into the case disconnects it! Super simple and easy to use!
The volume is literally as low as I can put it and it is so nice and loud, which I appreciate as well.
These are almost soundproof, which can be both amazing and kinda scary if you need to keep an ear out for your surroundings. Switching out the tips to a smaller one from the package can help make it less soundproof.
The audio is clear, but not super crisp, if that makes sense. The bass sounds really nice, so if you’re looking for a pair that plays the bass well, this is a nice choice too!
The buttons are easy to use as well.
So far, I am super happy with these headphones; they’re perfect as subtle, noise-cancelling, powerful, bass-enhanced earphones! Would recommend!

Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2020

I’ve been looking for a pair of Bluetooth earbuds for a while now that I did not have to spend a lot of money on in case I lost them.

As soon as I opened up the package, I was very surprised in a GREAT way is how small the holder was in comparison to the BOSE pair that runs just north of 300.

It’s a bit big in your pocket but I’ve traveled with these on several flights, in and out of TSA, long road trips, and they work GREAT in the gym.

I still have a love affair with full over the ear headphones but for a quick grab, go, and don’t want to have too much bulk in your bag, these are great.

Even work on my EOS R camera for listening to the audio instead of a line in pair.

The battery life is amazing, charge very fast, and pair right up to your iPhone with no issues.

I’ve never used Bluetooth for cycling however these are my new favorite earbuds for cycling for 20 to 30 miles at a time in the Arizona heat, never fell out once.

And once you have them in properly with the right fittings that are included, 90% of all the outside noise is completely gone because of how much your ears are sealed off by the outside ambient noise.

If you don’t want to spend over $100 on a pair of wireless headphones, these do a great job.

5.0 out of 5 stars Emphasis in the highs and the higher lows, value buy
Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2020

Nothing has been able to top my TRN paried with ZS7s, but these so far are the second best. I've tried a ton of bluetooth earphones and this was a relief to test. Out of the ankers (one of which I've returned) and other Chinese brands, these earphones have exceeded my expectations, but they weren't too high to begin with.

Initially, the response leans heavily in the high and some in the lower mid-high low frequencies. Anything in between is rather muddy and difficult to discern. It makes you a bit thirsty for what's missing. However, after about 14-16 hours of usage, the drivers began to deliver more of the lower frequency and the highs weren't so assaulting on the ears. It was a dramatic change, and it definitely puts the earphones higher on my list.

These are great for daily usage, and I wouldn't hate myself for losing these.

I haven't tested battery life yet. The earphones come with extra rubbers so the fit is perfect. They're also pretty light, and lengthy usage didn't hurt my ears.

By far, the biggest relief, is that each earphone is independent: the first one on will pair as a master, so you'll always be able to put the other back into the case to charge.

You'd be really silly to expect great response and dynamic range for the price you are paying. There are some significant cons, but when you look at the price you're paying, I can't imagine why anyone would complain.

I bought these earbuds for hands- and wire-free phone calls mostly, but also for listening to music while moving. They did not disappoint! Not only is the mic quality perfect for phone calls, but the sound is great! There is a surprisingly good range of volume options, getting really loud, but not loud enough to damage your hearing.

You can use SIRI with an IOS system by only clicking on the control buttons on the earbuds. You can also control volume, up or down, go back to the previous or next song, press pause or play, and answer, hang up, or reject a phone call all by just clicking on the earbuds! They were comfortable and they had extras of all the sizes of ear caps. I like that the earbuds are waterproof and even the case is waterproof so they won't get ruined by rain or sweat! They connected and stayed connected with my mac computer and iphone with no problems.

With the sound on, I couldn't hear anything but the music I was listening to, even when my husband was talking right in front of me! If I wanted to hear him talking (but really, ladies, who does want to hear their husband speaking? ;) I could just click the control button once to pause the music and I could hear him fine through the earbuds in my ears. I am so glad I got these and not the $250+ Apple airpods! I highly recommend these! (P.S. This is my honest feedback, asked for in exchange for a full refund for the product.)

What I like:
•I’m not deaf to the world around me when wearing these.
•After pairing with a device, they connect reliably and automatically. Every time. No daily fussing in your device settings needed.
•I’ve frequently worn them in the shower.(don’t ask..) I’m still careful not to drench them for a long period of time but I think you could.
•They stay in pretty well.
•The price.

I have small ear canals and have always had difficulty finding earbuds that will stay in. These work for me.

I honestly have no idea how the sound quality is compared to other earbuds. They sound just fine to me. I use them for listening to podcasts and the occasional video game.

Battery life is reasonable. 5-6 hours? More or less. This storage/charging case is tiny, which I like a lot.
It doesn’t have charging output (to plug a cord into and charge your phone with from the earbud case) like some brands do.

I liked these enough to buy a second pair for myself and one for my spouse.

Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
OK after a few months... I love these things. The haptic feedback of the physical button is superior to the "did I hit the right spot" aspect of others touch pads. Everything else works as advertised.

The case is well designed with a subtle non slip texture, magnetic lid and magnetic charge ports. The fit anywhere charge ports are especially appreciated if you have ever used a keyed holder where the left bud must go in the left charge port. The case fits well in a backpack, but not a pants pocket.

The buds pair easily and eagerly. The one button per bud control is nice for answering the phone and starting and stopping content as it works the same on either side. Volume up/down is a different story as one is left earbud and the other is right and there is really no easy way to tell the difference between the 2 buds.

The main problem is that the sound cuts out a good bit. If my phone is in my jacket pocket I'm mostly fine. If in my pants pocket and I'm walking I'm guaranteed to have the sound cut in and out.
Keep in mind that its easy to lose one of these things as well, I was outside and one fell out onto leaves and it took 1/2 hour and a bluetooth signal app to find it. I would like to see a color other than black for this reason.

When I opened up the amazon box I wasn't expecting much for the $33 price tag I paid for these earbuds. I checked the box to see what came with it and the cable was a USB C cable but the charging port is a Micro USB. I have plenty of Micro USB chargers so this wasn't an issue. I synced these buds to my Microsoft Surface Pro for a meeting and there were a few comments on how well they were able to hear me versus when using the Microsoft built in microphone. Now with COVID I was needing a flexible headset and I can use them all day with no problems. On the third day I was having some issues, I contacted support and they responded very quick and they showed me how to reset the earbuds. I paired them with an older LG G4 and i don't think they were 100% compatible with them and it caused issues when I was connected to my iPhone and Surface Pro. Also they act a little wonky when the battery is almost dead but that took a few days to happen. Now I am in the habit of putting them back in the case at the end of the day and recharging the case at the end of the week. No problems since!!

I am an audiophile and am almost constantly listening to audiobooks and podcasts. I had a couple of separate earbuds similar to these before but they eventually died, broke, or I lost them. I was looking for a replacement and this definitely is what I was looking for.

I love the charging case which is also waterproof. This keeps me from losing the earbuds and makes sure they are always charged. The waterproofing prevents me from worrying about it. The case is small enough to fit in a pocket. It is a smidge bulky but not too bad.

The earbuds are great as well. I use them separately as I like only using one at a time. I tried another earbud set with touch activation rather than a button, but the problem with those is they were too sensitive and would be activated by hair, accidental brushes, and water in the shower. These earbuds have a button so it is very hard to accidentally turn it on. I also love how they turn on a pair just by removing from the case and power off when you replace them. This is great as I don't have to manually turn them on or off and can just pop them into my ear.

These earbuds were exactly what I was looking for and are at a better price than many comparable products. I would highly recommend if this sounds like what you are looking for.

These are my first set of wireless earbuds and I have to say that I am overall satisfied with the product. For $30, it gives a great bang for the buck. It does not have the best quality sound in the world, but it still provides an immersive experience good enough for listening to your favorite music or listening to podcasts. The earbuds pair instantly with your smartphone as long as your phone’s Bluetooth is turned on. The pairing process is very simple and I have not run into any issues. The earbuds themselves are very light and there are different sized buds that come with the packaging so you can find the ones that best fit your ear. The charging case is nice and light, and has a magnetic mechanism that allows for easy charging for your earbuds.
There are a few cons but they are very miniscule in comparison to the pros. Adjusting the volume though the earbuds can be a little annoying at times due to the 1-2 second lag time that is present upon attempting to adjust the volume through the control buttons. Additionally, the control buttons themselves can be a bit hard to press down. Lastly, for the charging case itself, there is no “on” or “off” button, so the case is constantly charging when you put in the earbuds, even when you don’t want it to.
These cons aside, overall for the price, I am satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend it to a friend or a family member.

If you just need a cheap pair of wireless earbuds for work, shower (Yes, shower...GAME CHANGER) working out etc...These are the way to go. The ear buds were shipped to my door step promptly the next day. Packaging and accessories included was excellent. The carrying/charging case feels solid. The magnetic lids slaps close and STAYS closed while being ruffled around in my backpack so I dont have to worry about the earbuds falling off the charger. Sound quality is surprisingly great although I wish they could be a tad louder. They stay in my ear perfectly fine with several different size ear plugs to get the right fit and noise cancellation. Operating distance while away from device that's playing is great. They have not cut out on me yet while walking away from my phone. Now...I have been through my fair share of wireless ear buds and unlike the others, they advertise that they are not only sweat resistant but WATERPROOF. So I took a shower with them to test that statement and boy these turned out to be SOLID. I even dropped one in the shower from washing around my ears and I just picked it back up, placed it back in my ear and I was back to jammin out LOL! Overall great product for the price if your not looking for a high dollar, top brand pair of earbuds.

Color: BlackVerified Purchase
For what you paid, you're getting a pretty good deal. These little guys are comparable (in performance) to AirPods, but at a fraction of the cost. Here's the lowdown:

WHAT I LIKE:
- Ear "sealing" design: Take both of your fingers and plug your ears. This is what it sounds like when these are in your ears. Definitely masks out outside audio.
- Sleek black design
- Simple bluetooth setup
- 6x size options to perfectly fit your ear
- 5-6 hour music streaming capabilities (That's all the AirPods have, too...)
- Audio quality is on par with what I'd expect from other headphones.

WHAT I DON'T LOVE:
- Voice quality: when using video calling or phone calls, these guys add a little raspiness to the call. Not a huge deal, but definitely something I notice in audio performance.
- Not a US-based product: The manual / graphics / branding try to look like a US product, but it's clearly a Asian knockoff. There's grammatical errors and Chinese-esque graphics / fonts. I threw all that crap away already, so nothing to worry about anymore. My pride is over it!

OTHER NOTES:
- FIT: when I first put them in, I couldn't get them to stay in nicely. I then learned that you need to rotate them 90 degrees so that the outer tab of your ear holds them in. Now they stay in really well!

Overall, pretty happy with these guys for $35 bucks!

As a disclaimer, I am not an audiophile and only use these for casual use, such as watching videos or listening to background music while working, thus I cannot refute or support some of the other reviews that claim to have "great audio at XX frequencies."

However, I will say these are adequate and good earbuds for what I do with them. The sound isolation is about as good as you can get without active noise cancelling for earbuds. Though you can still hear outside noise with the earbuds in but without something playing, if you then turn them on with some soft music (I use calming piano music a lot), you will almost completely isolate yourself from the outside.

The pairing process is also very simple. No weird pairing codes or anything, just find on my device, click, and then they automatically pair in the future.

Battery life has lasted for the entire day so far. Can't comment on how long the battery stays this way, but it has been good for the last week.

I am, however, a bit scared that these might fall out if I move around too much, even though it hasn't happened. These are somewhat bulky, and I have tested how well they stay in by vigorously shaking my head. It feels like they may be getting looser, but I get dizzy before I can shake my head enough for them to fall out. I would probably not recommend them for vigorous activities.

I happened to notice these while scrolling through Amazon and after reading all they claimed to offer, I thought I really had nothing to lose. After all, it's Amazon, right? I could return them if I was disappointed. I ordered them. They literally showed up the next day! (surprise #1) I'm not incredibly tech savvy, so I was apprehensive about the setup. I worried for nothing. They practically paired themselves to my phone. There were soooo many sizes of covers to choose from. (surprise #2) I found the size that fit my ear best and in they went. When I turned my music on I couldn't believe the sound quality and bass. (surprise #3) The noise cancelling was fantastic too. If I could change anything at all, it would be a little extra room in the case to hold the small charging cable and extra covers. I absolutely need nothing else for these to be, by far, the best earbuds I've ever gotten. Totally worth it. I will definitely buy them as gifts for my kids. Shhhhh...don't tell them.

These are the best BT earbuds yet for my iPhone. They give true, excellent, binaural sound, and turn on and connect immediately as soon as you take one or both out of their charging case. You can use one or both, take them into the shower, switch ears with the same earbud--the R and L, while marked, seem to be angled the same.

Pairing was seamless--I just turned on BT in iPhone--no buttons to push. There are 3 sizes of ear cushions, and the fit (in my ears, anyway) is good, and they are comfortable.

I've been through far too many "waterproof" earbuds, what with poor battery times, need for USB plug-in charge, no charging case, mediocre sound quality. These are by far the best.

Interesting question as to whether they are better than the Apple AirPods (Plus), price not withstanding. There's no noise cancellation option, unless I've missed it. They work fine w Siri. There's no magnetic charging option, but with the long battery life of the charging case, it's hardly necessary. The charging case is a bit bigger than that of the AirPods.

Bottom line--for about 1/6 of the now widely available discounted price of the AirPods Plus, I would seriously consider these as my primary earbuds if you don't need the adjustable noise cancellation feature, magnetic charging, and some of the other iPhone-specific features of the AirPods.

I have wanted a pair of wireless earbuds for quite some time, but could not justify spending more than $150 for them. I saw an ad on Facebook for this model and thought I would give them a try.

I am blown away by their sound quality!!
I played a range of music including Classical, Jazz, and Viking Metal to get an idea of the sound range/quality and was very impressed. The high-end vocals/piano were crisp and clear. The Bass response was solid, and the mid-range came through with solid results.

Other Pros:
* Lightweight - I can keep them in my ears all day and barely notice them
* Battery Life - I can wear them all morning, then charge them during lunch, then wear them for the rest of the shift.
* Noise Cancellation - my wife came into the office and was calling my name. I didn't hear her until she tapped me on the shoulder.
* Size Attachments - there are multiple end caps to provide the proper fit for you.
* Ease of Pairing - it took less than 30 seconds to pair with my Mac and my iPhone, and they connect straight away when I take them out of the charging case.

I would highly recommend these wireless earbuds to anyone looking for a good quality at a great price!

These buds, with a magnetic charging case, ease of connectivity, waterproof, comfortable, secure fit, and darn good sound make this a great choice. I'm a bit of an audiophile and, for the price, I admit I was more than skeptical. However, I decided to trust the heavily weighted positive reviews before purchasing. I am very pleased indeed. I can't speak to the battery life (I only have them one day), but so far, these are great. I'm actually shocked at how good they are for the price. I have iPhone wired earbuds and, to be honest, I don't think there's much of a difference to warrant paying $150 for their wireless buds...

Update 6/20/20: For those that have complained the buds fall out, you have not taken the time to find the right ones to fit your ears. (personally, I like the small round "foam" ones best. ). For those that say the sound sucks, it's because you've not inserted them into your ears correctly. They have to be properly (and deeply) fitted/inserted to get good fidelity. As I've said previously, I have wired iPhone earbuds, and these sound as good, if not better. All in all, these are pretty dang good earbuds for the price. VERY easy to connect via BT but you need to ensure all other BT devices are off. I highly recommend these.

5.0 out of 5 stars Great value, impressive sound and comfort
Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2020

I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of these earbuds. My go-to headphones for travel have always been the Bose QC-35 ii over the ear and Jaybird X2s for hiking or working out. I can honestly say that these buds sound 1000x better than my Jaybirds (which were SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive). The BEBEN buds have a surprising amount of low end bass and provide really solid sound isolation. The highs are crisp and lows hit very strong at medium to high volumes. Mids could be a bit fuller, but honestly these have a great sound profile for EDM and podcast/audio book listening.

The buds are very light and comfortable on the ears - so far they have been in for an hour straight and no apparent discomfort. Pairing is seamless, and the case footprint is significantly smaller than I thought from the photos. The case is approximately 2 inches in diameter and inch and a half thick, so it packs really well.

My only gripe with these buds are the button controls - they are not very intuitive and a bit of a pain to press down, as the buds are lodged in your ears. If you are running, and want to change volume up or down, you have to stop, grip the buds with your thumb and middle finger and hold down the button on either left or right headphone. Doing away with the buttons altogether and using a touch sensitive surface would make the usability of these much better. Nonetheless, you really cant beat these for the price.

5.0 out of 5 stars Wow! Better Than Others I've Tried
Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
This is my third pair of headphones that are similar to these. All I can say is WOW! I only got them this afternoon but I've been using them. The sound quality is better than others I have tried, specifically the bass. For the price you can't go wrong on these, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another pair. As far as battery life goes, I typically don't listen for too terribly long before I'm done. But I've listened for almost 2 hours and they were still going when I put them back in the case. They fit in the ear well with the correct adjustments. They have buttons on the side to stop, play, skip forward/back, answer calls, etc. However the left one does something different than the right...just a bit strange to get use to but I'm sure it will be second nature when I start using them more.

Instructions say they will work swimming/shower/rain. I'd be a bit nervous to use them for personal reasons while swimming...would hate for them to get ruined. They say not to use them diving but I'd assume if you put your head under water you'd be ok. I hope they last a long time and if not they are backed by a decent warranty for a set of headphones. As long as the company follows through with any issues that might creep up I am happy. Overall great quality and a sweet charging case..it even vibrates when you plug it in. I thought that was cool.

These came at a great price and I love the dark green colour. I bought 4 and am pleased to have back ups for when I inevitably lose them. (no guilt at this price!) They're not the most comfortable, but it doesn't bother me. When my ears start to hurt I swap from L or R. The single pairing mode is a huge plus. The audio also isn't the best and I wish it was a little louder at max volume, but again it works as intended. I hope I don't need more then the 4 I've already purchased, but if I do I will definitely get these again!

Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2020

Honestly, this product surprised me. It did everything that was advertised and it did it well. Here are my comments:

- the product box and earbuds case are both very sleek and efficiently take up little room, allowing for easy transport
- the sound quality, which I found to be crisp and excellent, is better than most earbud brands out there
- the user experience I had when it came to setting up my earbuds and learning its features was very good, and although some things aren't outlined in the instructions (such as how to answer and hang up phone calls), I quickly learned the skills
- although it took some fidgeting to try to find the best fit for my ears, when I did finally find it they fit incredibly
- just as advertised, the earbuds are waterproof (I fully submerged mine in water and the sound quality was still great
- the price was incredible, and although I did get a 20% off coupon (leading me to pay only $31.19), the $39.99 price definitely still seems worth it
- lastly, the buttons that control the earbuds are very

There were only three things that bothered me. First of all, the right earbud lowers the volume whilst the left earbuds raises it. I'm used to it being the other way around, but that's a personal preference. Second, raising/lowering the volume takes up quite a bit of time due to the fact that you have to hold down the button for about three seconds just to raise/lower the volume once. Lastly, the earbuds don't really fit too well, and running can cause them to fall off even on the largest setting. If you don't plan on moving too much with them, then these should work just fine fr you, otherwise I recommend looking for another pair.

Here is my overall rating:

User Experience: 4.5/5
- Although the experience was very smooth, I would change a few things here and there, including adding more instruction to the instruction manual.

Sound Quality: 5/5
- Honestly, the sound is incredible, and if I hadn't been told that I was wearing an earbud (and if I couldn't feel the earbud) then I would definitely think that sound was coming from a professional grade speaker.

Comfortableness: 4/5
- Yes, the earbuds are extremely comfortable, but I feel like some tweaks could be made here and there that would truly maximize the comfortableness.

Fit: 2/5
- The fit is truly the worst part about this product. If you stay still then the earbuds will stay on, but the moment you begin to move (such as run, swim, or just walk) they will most likely fall out, even on the largest ear piece.

Price: 4/5
- Please don't be alarmed by the rating on this category, the price is still amazing, but I believe that the best price is around $25.00 - $30.00.

Total: 3.9/5
- Overall, this product is amazing and, in my opinion, worth every penny, unless you need ear buds that will stay on whilst running or doing some other form of activity that requires movement.

You get a good pair of headphones for the price !
They will last you about 3 hours of consecutive use as advertised. Solid fit and decent insulation from outside noise.
The bass is actually not bad but the rest of the sound is pretty straight forward.
They won’t stay in during sport activities but you can ask it all for that price .
The marking of Left and Right will wear out very quick so gotta make sure you put them in correctly.

The quality of these headphones are great depending on what your plan is for their use. The sound quality was stellar and they fit in the ears nicely. I purchased them to wear to bed to help me fall asleep. They paired great with my phone and I though they are a little large for a side sleeper, I felt these were going to be much better than the corded ear buds I had. I charged them up so they would be ready. The first night, they were great! The battery lasted all night. I didn't recharge them before going to bed the second night because they had been in their case all day and the case itself had a charge so I thought I was fine. The second night, I was woken up by them saying LOUDLY (much louder than I had the volume set for) in my ear "BATTERY LOW", then a few minutes later "POWERING OFF". Well, that was a rude awakening so I thought my solution was to charge them up before going to bed. The next night, same thing.. but worse. Each ear bud yelled in my ear on separate timelines. First the right ear, battery low! Powering off! Took that one out and put in the case. The left one was still playing music so I felt I was fine. NOPE! About 10 minutes later, BATTERY LOW, POWERING OFF! Not sure why I didn't just remove them both after the first time they yelled at me. Hubby was still snoring so I was hoping they would just shut off instead of announcing their departure? Who knows. Anyway, boxed them up for a return the next morning.

If your plan is to wear these while awake for bluetooth ear buds. You absolutely can't go wrong with this purchase... they are great. But they are not great for sleep. I had asked this question prior to ordering but didn't get a response before I placed the order. The response I got only said that they aren't good for sleep. Well, some people feel it is not good to sleep in earbuds or to keep them in your ears for an extended period of time, so with the review giving no explanation as to why, it wasn't very valuable. This review is my why they are NOT GOOD FOR SLEEP.

Update as of March 2021:
Support did end up following up a few days later, with a few other suggestions regarding troubleshooting the charging issue. I tried them for a few more days and gave up. Support followed up and we’re very kind to send another pair which were delivered within 48 hours. They very understanding and patient during this whole process - I’ve since upped my review to four stars. At this price point you do get what you pay for, however, excellent customer service is very hard to come by these days! If anything, I now know a few different approaches on how to address certain issues that may come up should they third pair act up. I use them frequently and have tried numerous models within the same price point, these so far are my go to pair. I highly recommend following the instructions on applying for their warranty if you are considering purchasing these.
——

I’m on my second pair.
I’ll try to keep this short, these are good for the price (under 20$). These work great in a pinch. Pair nicely with iphone, sound is okay nothing mind blowing. They charge relatively quickly, my only gripes with these is that if you use these relatively frequently they will no hold a charge or one bud will eventually fail to either hold a charge, charge at all, or turn on fully. I didn’t apply for the three year warranty through Beben with my first pair. I applied with my second, within about a month one bud started acting out as I described above, and I emailed support which were helpful in giving instruction on how to ‘reset and revive’ the bud. However, all four now won’t hold a charge for more than 2-8 minutes each after being charged for over 24 hours... support has magically ghosted me for the time being and are not responsive since feb 18th, 2021. Hoping to either get a refund or another pair. Don’t purchase these for over $20.

4.0 out of 5 stars Returned After 3 Uses...Making a 2nd Attempt Though - UPDATE
Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
I had been looking for wireless headphones for a while and was not interested in Air Pods so when I saw these I was immediately interested. I read the reviews on all items before I purchase and the vast majority of them for these headphones were positive so I thought I would give them a try....for the price it wouldn't really hurt.

When they arrived, I immediately opened them up and set about charging them. I left them alone until all the lights were lit indicating they were charged. I then paired them with my phone (an Android) and my iPad. They paired very easily and I used them to watch a Ted Talk and the sound quality was good and they were very comfortable. I put them back on the charger and planned on using them when I mowed my lawn the next day.

The next day, put them in and turned on Sirius XM and they paired instantly. About 10 minutes into mowing my lawn, the left earbud gave the low battery alert and then shut off instantly. The right one was still working fine so I just took out the left and finished my work. I thought maybe the connection in the case wasn't good so I put it on the charger to give it another chance.

I pulled them out the next day to use when I was doing some writing and again paired quickly but this time to my laptop. The sound quality was again good and no issues....and then 10 minutes later the left one gave the low battery alert and immediately shut off. They had been on the charger for over 12 hours at that point so I knew I had a defective earbud.

While I am returning them, I am going to give another pair a try before I give up completely. I will update after the second set arrives...I want to at least give them another shot because the sound quality and comfort were great

UPDATE - I received a new pair and thus far they have been great. No issues with this pair and the company have been great to work with. I would definitely recommend these earbuds...very comfortable, easy to pair, and the sound quality is great. You can't beat the price either!!

4.0 out of 5 stars A good bluetooth earbud with some connection issues. *UPDATED*
Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
I want to start this by saying I use this mainly in MONO mode, which is basically only using one earbud at a time. I find it rude to have both in when I am working so I only use one, and if one runs out of batteries I can just switch to the other.

I usually use another brand which no longer is being made or is currently unavailable. So I was on the lookout for a new set. I washed my old ones or lost one by accident...its always something that makes me replace them. They never died and they were work horses and I loved them.

https://www.amazon.com/ELIPHONIC-Bluetooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Microphone/dp/B07K8RW959

That's the link to the ones I am talking about, these had the same kind of feel to the ones I had before with the ability to work in mono mode (they don't all do this)...and honestly this one doesn't really work well in mono mode either. *UPDATED* - I originally had issues with it not switching without me resetting the bluetooth settings, because it uses the same connection. While it still only uses one connection instead of two for each ear, the problem seem to have gone away and it connects properly, so I added a star.

Also, they occasionally will drop the connection. I don't know why. The phone is not moving, I am right next to it...but I lose the connection. It will reconnect in a few seconds, but it's still annoying. *UPDATED* This is still an issue. It happens maybe once or twice a day and it's a minor inconvenience. However that's why I took the star off for this.

I give it four stars because the sound is nice, and I like the case. It has magnets that will lock the earbud in place and there is a light on the earbud that shows when it is charging. *UPDATED* The loss of connection is what made me give it 4 out of 5 stars.

For $38, these are a quality pair of budget wireless earbuds.

The sound isolation and fit is great, as the earbuds come with 6 different pairs of tips to make sure they have a secure fit in your ear. I tested the fit while playing rigorous VR games like Thrill of the Fight and Superhot, and they never fell out.

That being said, these aren't for gamers. The earbuds have a small delay in audio feed, which you won't notice when doing something like watching videos but will probably be frustrating to use in rhythm based games like Geometry Dash, Osu, or Beat Saber.

The main use for these earbuds is clearly intended to be fitness. The edge-less case design, strong magnetic case lid and optional case strap all scream "attach this to your bag while you're on a jog." It's easy to keep this attached to a bag as well, as in my testing, I went over a week without having to recharge the case once. Extremely convenient.

The case is small enough to be pocketable, but probably not if you're wearing tight pants as it is a little tall. Again, still great for fitness or outside ventures.

The audio quality isn't the best around, but for the price, it's reasonable. The highs are a bit lacking and crackly at times, but these buds' strength is definitely bass. Low ends are crystal clear.

Finally, one surprising benefit of these earbuds is call quality. In comparison to other wireless earbuds I've tested, these have the best mic quality of all of them and are just as effective if not more effective than your actual phone.

For the average consumer, I'd say these earbuds are your best bet. Hopefully this review is helpful.

These earbuds are all you need for an earbuds. The sound quality is about what you'd expect for an earbud. But you never feel like it is too quiet. Half the time I have the volume on near silent because it can go so loud.

The battery is also pretty good lasting about 10 hours from my experience. If you don't use your phone and let them go on standby they can last longer. The included charging case usually fills up in around an hour while being able to fully charge the earbuds around 3 times so pretty happy with the battery life.

I constantly see poor reviews for earbuds that cost more than $100 but I have rarely seen anything bad said about those in the $30-$50 price range. I think beyond that point the rest of the features are more gimmicky if anything. If you want the best, secure and low profile earbud you can find on the market then here you go.

The only complaint I have would be that there is no software paired with the product to adjust the volume on your phone or pause it there. Using the buttons on earbud are a pain since your are pressing them deeper into your ear if you use one hand so you have to kind of hold the bud with your middle finger and thumb while pressing the button with your index finger which when on the go it's better to just unlock your phone and pause or raise the volume through there.

Overall though, very happy with my product. Would recommend to anyone who wants an extremely portable sound experience.

Bought these twice, first set was for a friend. Says they sound great, just like their previous set which were skull candy but they lost one. Batteries lasts longer than the skull candy wireless buds, and their case didn't need charging for a week.
The first set came as usb c.
Second set arrived today. Was not usb c. Slightly disappointed because not only does the description have a picture of a usb c tip, it also claims the case is a type c. Disappointing in that the first pair was usb c and my friend has an iPhone so didn't really care. I on the other hand have a phone with a usb c connection so it would've been ideal. Whatever, they sound pretty good.
In my household between my husband and I, we have 3 sets of bose over the ear bluetooth headphones. Two of which are noise cancelling, the new silver ones and the last gen black ones. He also has the sound sport free, wireless in ear bose buds.
Not going to say these are of the same quality or sound but for the sale price of less than $15, and a normal price of $25, I'd buy them again if I lose one, and that is the perfect use for these. Activities where it is possible to lose one.

Update:

After seeing my review, Beben offered to send a replacement, which arrived quickly. The product looked the same. I wanted to give them a fair evaluation so I charged them over night. Then I didn't have a chance to use them for several days, mostly because I was not home. Beben emailed me on June 28th and 30th, and July 2nd, 6th, and 8th to request that I remove my review. That doesn't seem right. But an update seems fair.

The earbuds and charger look good. They're fairly comfortable even for small ears, and came with several rubbery earbud covers to fit well. They also have a convenient charger cable to connect to my laptop or USB wall outlet charger. Nice case. Arrived in good condition. Holds a charge for at least two hours. Pairs and connects well and stays connected, until I walk about 20' away from the paired device, when the sound cuts in and out, but didn't disconnect even when I walked from the back bedroom to the kitchen. Overall, I'm satisfied with the product and the price.

Original Review:

Everything works except one earbud won't hold a charge. Beben suggested trying a different cable and port, which is nonsensical, but I did it. I also tried switching them in the charging case, which didn't help. The earbud is defective. Here's what they look like after charging for 24 hours, again.

Looks good. Fairly comfortable even for small ears. Nice case. Arrived in otherwise good condition.

I saw other reviews/questions regarding earbuds not charging. Took a chance on them. Disappointed in the product and customer service, and wouldn't recommend.

I just unboxed these a half hour ago and was very excited for them. I have trouble keeping normal earbuds in my ears, let alone wireless ones but I was pleasantly surprised that they came with a piece small enough and it fits comfortably. (I also have tics in which I shake my head a lot, and they stayed in!!)
Sound quality is good from what I can tell, and it seems to cancel a lot of noise from around me.

The one thing that is bothering me is the infidelity of the connection. I will be listening to music for a minute and it'll be fantastic; smooth, clear, balanced... and then it starts to cut in and out for indefinite amounts of time.
I haven't seen anything about the connection once they are paired, so maybe I just got a defective pair? I will have to play around with them more and I'll update if anything changes.

Update:: I've had them for a few hours now and have messed around with them to find that the bluetooth connectivity issue was my phone (I have an old Galaxy Prime J7 whatever the heck you call it and it constantly gives me trouble with everything I do). I have them connected to my computer (playing the same music as before) right now and can hear it clearly and listen to it when I am two floors apart from my computer.
After figuring this out, the product went from 2 to 4 stars. I wish there was more I could do to fix the issue with my phone, but it is nothing the manufacturer did wrong/could do

I came from years of buying Bose Noise Cancellation headsets and wired earbuds. I wanted to go wireless but did not want to pay over $100 for new earbuds as well as loose sound quality. I was very surprise and happy with this purchase.

The earbuds came in a nice premium box and were fully charge right out the box. I was able to us them right away to go jogging. They had a perfect fit and never popped out of my ears while jogging. (That was a big problem with my old wired earbuds). The sound quality was very good. It had a heavier bass than what I was used too, but I liked it. I wished it had a better high to well balance the heavier bass. After 10 min of running and listening to music, I got use to it and it did not bother me.

PROS:
* Comfortable - Came with multi choice of ear cushion sizes.
* Good sound - heavy bass
* Long lasting battery.
* Easy to use charging case- Fits easily in your pocket.
* Talk quality is great. (No one complained about not hearing me clearly)
CONS:
* I wish it had a better equalizer from the highs to bass.
* Wish it had a digital display on the case to show battery percentage.

Overall , this was a good purchase and value for the price. I'm very happy with this purchase.

I was sick of tangled cords at work from my wired earbuds so I decided to go wireless. Unfortunately it seems like some manufacturers think they're shipping you a product made out of gold. I wasn't willing to pay hundreds for a halfway decent pair.

I've been using these for a couple weeks now. They come with adjustable rubber pieces so I was able to find ones that fit my ears well. I can't speak to the battery life over an extended period but I can tell you they haven't run out across 4-5 hours of use a day at work. Since the initial pairing, they've automatically paired with my phone each day without issue.

The sound quality is excellent for the price. I'm sure there might be better sound on super expensive ones, but I didn't need all that at work anyway. Sometimes I want both buds in, sometimes only one. When I take one out and put it back in the case, it automatically unpairs and puts the sound to only the one remaining bud. When you take the second bud out, it automatically resets to stereo.

I'll update this in 6-12 months to add comments on longevity.

Edit: 4/20/21 Down from 5 to 4 stars, as battery life has degraded more than I would expect over the year. With the price, it's still a decent deal.

UPDATE: These are decent for the price. The buttons and audio menu system are ok, it's not a great experience adjusting volume. The lag is pretty bad on video and the connection range isn't fantastic compared to other bluetooth speakers/headphones I've owned. That said, for the price they are a great entry into true wireless earbuds.

I haven't had these for very long, and will update if anything changes. They arrived fully charged and I have been using them for some time now. Sound quality is good, nice bass. Charging case is smaller than I expected, wouldn't want to carry it in my pocket all day, would do fine in a small bag, maybe back pocket. They are comfortable enough, with several ear bud sizes.

The buttons are a little annoying to push while in your ear, if you push directly you end up mashing it down your ear canal, so you kinda need to push up into your head and risk dislodging the earbud or use your whole hand to stabilize it. Minor quip, but affects usability some.

Overall, they seem great so far. $30 is a great value and not much a risk to try out some completely wireless earbuds. 3 years ago if you told me I could effectively get a pair of airpods for $30 I would've assumed it's a scam.

I knew based on how much money I was spending on these, that they weren't gonna be top quality or anything. So I'm not gonna go and say that these are garbage or anything like that, I'll just give my experience with them. I do like that they come with many sizes of cushion pieces to put in your ear, especially because my right ear needs a different size than my left. The battery life is pretty decent, but could be better. I'd say the headphones themselves last around 4-5 hours. The case's battery life is meh, not as great. Fairly comfortable, they do ache after a while but I think that just may be any earbud for me. Sometimes they just cut out randomly, like they'll stay connected but I'll have no sound. It's happened during my online therapy sessions, and when that happens, I can't hear her and even if I disconnect my earbuds and use my internal microphone on my laptop, she still can't hear me. But overall, these are decent headphones and for what I paid, I'm not that upset. If you're looking for bluetooth headphones on the cheap, I'd recommend these. But if you're willing to spend a little extra, maybe find something else.

4.0 out of 5 stars Great sound quality, battery life, and decent noise cancellation, but very glitchy connection
Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2020

For the price these are pretty nice. Good build quality, suprisingly good sound, and satisfying battery life. The buds themselves fit comfortably in the ear and do not fall out during strenuous activity. But for some reason the connection to my phone breaks up randomly and repeatedly during use, especially when my phone is in my pocket but pretty much any time. Very irritating. Also, the right bud does not sync with the left Bud's volume and is quieter half of the time, and the touch controls occasionally don't work when double tapping.

UPDATE: The company contacted me personally after seeing my review. They explained it was a defective pair of buds and offered to either refund me or send me a new pair for free. Very kind and considerate customer service. I accepted the new pair. They work near perfectly. Same pros as with the first pair, but I do still experience some interference while doing hard work, in construction. 95% of the time they work perfect and I can only assume the glitches are a product of busy surroundings, there are many things to interfere with the connection. In all other cases they work as they should and meet my expectations well.

If, like me, you intend to use these for work, then these earbuds do the job. They do everything sufficiently well to be useful, and they cost a quarter to a fifth of what the most popular buds in the market cost. You can understand calls clearly, and music is ok. The microphone captures your voice sufficiently well. People have mentioned they could hear a minor background noise when I speak, but they could understand me fine. The charging case is also ok, albeit you should know that the buds come with a USB - C cable, and the case uses Micro USB, so you'll need to get your own charger. Luckily, all the non-Apple cellphones, speakers, and other tech gadgets up to a couple of years ago used to use Micro USB so you're likely to have a charger somewhere in your house already. Aesthetics are ok as well, the buds protrude significantly as you can see in the photos other people have posted in their reviews. All in all, I think these are good for anyone that has a very tight budget and really needs to be hands free while in phone calls.

4.0 out of 5 stars Nice earbuds
Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
The battery life for continued use is about 6 straight hours. But that cool charging pack case can give them a charge even while it is not plugged in. So I throw them in the case during my lunch break and that way they last me all day.

They fall out of my ears, I’m not sure if I have a strange shape to my ear or if the ear piece is just not very ergonomic, but I went and bought a cheap over the ear hook to try to keep them from falling out while I’m working.

I love all the different rubbers ears piece covers, but have yet to figure out which is best for my ears.

Because the buds slowly slip out of my ears there is NO noise canceling, in fact sometimes the outside noise like weed wacker that I’m using drowns out my music. But the earbuds still seem to keep my ears from ringing after I turn the machine off. So they are helping.

Overall I’m happy with them.

I received these 2 days ago and I am very impressed. I'll be honest, I thought at the price point that these may not be what was advertised.
I did read reviews from other purchasers and they seemed very happy with these headphones.
I took them out of the charging case and they paired easily, without any problem. Remember to take the little clear piece of plastic off of each headphone for them to be able to charge in the case.
I used them yesterday when I cut the grass and the noise cancelling was great, the clarity of sound through these is excellent. What I really liked is that they sit almost flush in the ear, which will be important for me when I cycle, as sometimes I get a lot of wind noise from other types.
I haven't ridden wearing them yet, so I cannot give a clear indication of the noise cancelling ability and I cannot attest to the battery life either as I have only just used them.
All I will say is, so far so good.

I've been using these earbuds for some months now (maybe 3 or so). Great piece, awesome sound, fantastic noise cancelation. And it's small enough for it to be unnoticed by others, or even the wearer. So comfortable, doesn't fall out unless you take it out. If you switch ears, it might be uncomfortable because L was designed for left ear and R was designed for right ear. I mostly use them one at a time because I still want to hear what's going on around me, and I'd want one eardrum to take a break. So when one is low on power, I can put it back in the case to charge while I use the other. However, about 3 weeks ago, the right ear stopped working. No matter how long I leave it to charge, when I try to use it, it says "battery low, shutting down". Such a bummer. So I'm stuck with the left ear. It still works great, but I wish I still had my options.

I've always used ear buds that can hang around my ears and sometimes have a neck strap, but I thought I'd try these smaller buds that suck into your ears. While they are in they sound good, have good battery life and I like the click buttons rather than the touch sensors to control playback and volume. My problem is they just won't stay in my ears. Fortunately, if the left one falls out it usually goes into my shirt pocket and the other one I've been able to find nearby when it falls out. It's just a matter of time before they go someplace I can't retrieve them. Until then I'm going to keep using them.

As of this date, I have only had these earbuds for a few weeks. At first I was very happy with them. Now not so much. They worked just fine for the first couple of weeks. Over the last week or so the earbuds consistently loose the Bluetooth link (link loss). This happens even when both the device & earbuds are fully charged and within inches of one another. So frustrating.
The battery life is just okay.

Update June 4, 2020: The company was quick to respond and has reached out to me to offer a replacement or refund. I requested a replacement. So. I am very happy with their conscientious customer service and quick response to my emails. I am upgrading this review to 4 stars solely for their customer service response.

Most reviews seem like these are the handed down from the heavena. A small few seem to think there is some global conspiracy behind the 5 star. I will say honestly they are not perfect, but are indeed pretty good for the price. Upon receiving them I took them for a short test drive in a noisy factory. The ambient noise blocking is pretty good, possibly too good with the specific tips. Really can't hear the world around me, even with nothing playing. The sound is honestly better than I expected from something this price. After 20 minutes I placed them back in thier charger. Left ear magnetized into place and went into charging mode. Right ear instead swapped back into pairing mode till I forcefully turned it off. After further inspection, I determined there was a small bit of residual plastic inside one of the holesthe probe is pressed into. A little scraping with the edge of a razor blade remedied the situation, and all seems good now.

I love these headphones! They have amazing sound and when you wear them, you can barely hear anything outside of them! I mow my lawn with then in and I barely hear the mower! The biggest problem I have experienced though is the mic. When I sit in a quiet room or in my car while it's off, the person on the other side can hear me great! But as soon as I go where there is any background noise, the mic starts picking up everything in the background and I kind of cut out pretty frequently.

If you are wanting these to work out with, or do chores with, or just to listen to anything on them, they are wonderful! But if you are wanting these for use on the phone, I would look into other products, albeit, they still work as a mic!

I like that the earbuds fit nice and tightly in my ear. There are a lot of cool features, but it takes a while to learn how to use them with only one button to control them on each ear.

I've been an audio engineer for many years and I have to say the sound is very much hyped up. I guess people like to have loads of boom and sizzle which is why they design products to sound this way. I have a graphic equalizer on my phone so I can adjust the sound so they sound pretty good for music. I have to turn down the mid treble quite a bit. I found that if I boost the bass even a little they start distorting because the bass is already turned up so much.

It's been a year, these headphones worked great until recently. I guess 10 months is a decent amount of time for headphones but definitely not great.

Very good headphones for the price. I walk a lot and I only use one ear bud so I can hear the traffic around me. These are pretty good because I am able to hear my music really well over the traffic and I don't have the other bud dangling from me during my walks. I bring only the one I plan to use and I have had no issues with sound quality. The battery life could be better on the buds which is why I couldn't give a 5 star review, but no complaints over here.

I have literally done my research when trying to buy a good pair of ear buds that fell into a cheap price bracket. These have to be the best. The sound quality is very good, they don't fall out when you go for a run or when you work out. There are many ear bud covers to choose from so it's really hard to find one that won't fit your ear. They are small and they fit nicely in the ear. The only thing that I dislike about these is, whenever I connect them to my computer the audio fades in and out all the time. I'm guessing they're not all that good for computers. I have no issue with this while using my Samsung galaxy cell phone though. Overall this was a good buy.

I absolutely love these Earbuds, or at least one of them. I typically only wear one at a time. Unfortunately, soon after I put one of them in, there is a loud clicking noise and then the sound quality drops significantly. I have sorted them so I know which one is the better earbud and use only that one. When the better bud is recharging I have been forced to listen with the other. It reminds me of the days before "stereo" sound. Other than that, the microphone is great and my callers have no problems hearing me. They fit well, stay in and are easy to use. Battery life is really great. Make the change from Mono to stereo and I'd give them a 5.

The sound quality is just fine for podcasts, but will likely be lacking if you are used to higher quality headphones for music listening.

I love the idea of using one ear piece while the other is setting in the deck fully charged. If one goes out I can always use the other while thr previous one is recharging. Also the portable charging cool but could possibly be a bit slimmer for other people, for me its good because it reminds me that I have a portable recharging station for my headset.
Another thing I like is the voice that indicates that the battery for the headset is low.

My only dislike really is the warning for the low battery....it's super short, probably a minute or two before they just shut down.

I read A lot of reviews. I always Start with the 1*s. So I went With these. Pretty cool set up. Made well. Good sound. Reach further than other ones I’ve owned. I like The way I can Utilize functions on the buds including rewinding shoes or music. The noise canceling is great too.
Cons. They are small but bulky. Basically like having a medium sized grape sit in the center of your ear. With that if you mess w your hair a lot or bump them they will easily fall out. If you don’t than they are fine.

These headphones really surpassed my expectations. They cancel out all outside noise and sound quality is impressive. My only issue is I've had these for a little over a year and the left one just stopped working! Drains out the charging base and dies right when it turns back on. Otherwise great headphones.

4.0 out of 5 stars Only one earbud has a working mic.
Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2020
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
I purchased these because of the function to use the earbuds separately. This would allow me to always have one charging and operating for communication - however - only one of the earbuds registers a mic on my computer. Either I have a defective pair or the product information is very misleading.

Other than that I would have rated these 4-5 stars and if the seller can resolve this for me I would gladly change my rating as I enjoy the functionality of it all otherwise.

Update: I received a replacement and both mics are working - updated rating to 4 stars

I have had these for over two months and waited until i starting going back to gym to write a review. I like everything about them. They are AirPod quality at a reasonable price. If i had a negative, it would be the range of distance from ear buds to my phone. I can’t go more than maybe 10 feet away from my phone before it starts to mess up. That’s not a problem because my phone is always with me in arms reach while at the gym unless i go to restroom.

Overall, my experience has been really positive. Haven’t yet used these in water but have tried wearing with just one headphone and it works. Sound quality is similar to other cell phone headphones (good but not mind-blowing). I also enjoy that these headphones pair easily (and my phone remembers so I do not have to re-pair). Additionally, I like the fit and the case having magnets that hold your headphones in place.

...Also, a great feature (compared to Apple AirPods) is that you can change the volume with buttons on the headphones.

Note: I received this product for free in exchange for a review.

Very solid product, for the price. I had to have a product that could control volume and song skipping via the earpieces and with a button, and not those annoying touch sensors. This product does that. The only thing I'm disappointed in is that the case, although narrow in circumference, is a little too tall to comfortably keep in a pocket that has other items in it, as well.

Also sometimes I want a very low volume:

These are cheap headphones, and for what they are, so far I find them functional. Not good bass, and on certain songs the bass drum can sound crackly in the right pod, like a speaker that’s blown out. The S’s in both music and podcasts are very sibilant so if that’s something that bothers you take note. I had no trouble pairing them straight out of the box, and they’re easy to use. They’re relatively comfortable. Ultimately, I wanted something simple and cheap that didn’t cost $250 and these do the trick.

Pairing was trivial, sound quality is decent enough, sound modes are interesting but not astonishing. Battery lasts all day, and it also works when connected to a charger. Controls on the headset work as expected once you figure out how to find them by touch. No noise cancellation, but that's not what I purchased and certainly not for this price. The foam ear cushions keep out most ambient anyway, and the microphone has not upset any of my clients when in meetings with them. I'd buy them again.

The music has alot of deep bass and it sounds very rich and full. There's no static or excess noise. The buttons on the headphones are also very responsive and work good. The headphones feel very durable if I were to twist or turn them they wouldn't break. The headband is also comfortable and it doesn't hurt my head at all and I have a big head lol.

Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2023

I’m 58 and these are my first headphones! I’m deaf in one ear & can hardly hear out the other ear so got these so I don’t bother the neighbors. I watch some YouTube and now I swear I’m hearing sounds I’ve never heard before. I pick up every little sound like someone dropped a pen in the background.
Only thing I had to get used to was the tiny little buttons, I kept hitting the power button when I put them on and whenever I touched them basically. I haven’t fooled with any of the other buttons to make any adjustments, the sound is awesome. I also like that they have the cord I can plug into the amp for playing guitar. No they’re not sound deafening, but I can crank these up and no one in the room can hear it!

First, let me say I’m no audiophile, so I can’t make any judgement call from a technical point of view.
I can tell you however, they provide a clear signal and do a good job of cutting out background noise.
I use these when riding with a van full of enthusiastic grandkids who have yet to figure out what the word “quiet” means…at least in practice.
They are used for both audio books and Spotify music. Battery life lives up to expectations and they are fairly lightweight considering their size. I’m VERY happy with them.

Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2023
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
I wanted to watch tv after my wife has gone to bed, in a manner consistent with both allowing her to sleep and me to thus survive the experience. Additionally, I did not want a lengthy cable tethering me to either the television or soundbar. As neither the tv nor my soundbar are capable of bluetooth connectivity, I pondered this quandary for quite some time, I am sorry to say. Then... epiphany! An Amazon 4K firestick costs about 30 bucks and IS a bluetooth device. Subsequent research revealed this lovely set of headphones is highly rated by thousands of reviewers and furthermore, was obtainable from Amazon without a co-signature from my bank's loan officer, thereby allowing the occasional, continued purchase of red meat.

On the technical side, instructions to connect and disconnect were clear and easily accomplished. The sound quality is very good, with three different acoustical settings. Surprisingly, I found I enjoy the heavy bass setting best. Also, the controls are ergonomically placed to allow for easy manipulation and another plus is the lengthy battery life, which frankly, is quite astonishing!

Overall, I am happy to be able to say these are terrific headphones! I am also quite certain I would be even happier, were I able to overcome my propensity to refer to them as 'Duck ass' headphones and avoid the subsequent disapprobation which ensues.

I'd been on the hunt for a decently-priced, over-ear, bluetooth headphone for well over a year (at least) before I tried these. I have a fairly big head, so a lot of the headphones that I tried, I ended up having to return bc they were uncomfortable and too tight. Then there was another pair from some other brand that fit, but had trouble actually connecting to my laptop via bluetooth. I finally bought this pair, and so far, so good. I've had them for a few months and have used them for several hours pretty much everyday, and they are fantastic for the price. They fit my head, connect easily, and the sound quality is pretty good, too (although I'm no expert). I'm glad I bought them!

I have 2 sets of these headphones and they work very well for me. I use them at work daily and at the gym. The sound quality is great for me, but I’ve never used “high end” headphones so I cant make the comparison.

Battery life is excellent. I’ve had them for 6 months and the battery has never died on me. I charge them a couple times per week.

My only complaint is with certain things they’re not loud enough. Specifically phone calls. My job is a noisy environment so if someone calls me I can’t hear them very well. But for music and podcasts, it’s usually not a problem.

I’d recommend these if you’re looking for a affordable set of BT headphones

My son needed some headphones so he can use them at school while he is doing his school work (Teachers allow the use of headphones while doing classwork). He wanted something that was noise cancelling because sometimes the kids in his class get a little too loud. I started searching for something that would give me more bang for my buck without stressing my pocket book. Came across these and read the reviews and decided to give them a try.

My son has been using these for a few days and he is stoked about them. These headphones are sturdy and do not feel cheap. All the buttons work and don't feel fragile. My son says that they have a long battery life (he runs them all day pretty much) and that they are comfortable on his head and ears. I'm not 100% sure if these are noise cancelling, but my son says when he has them on and has his music playing, that is all he hears.

When it comes to Kids and headphones sometimes it's better to get a good cheaper pair rather than paying hundreds of dollars on something that could get broken, lost or stolen. Would definitely buy these again. May get a set for myself for the gym.

Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2022

Great headphones at a reasonable price, and the sound quality is on par with any other major headphones. Bought these originally for music and videos, but have been using them for gaming as well. They are light weight, comfortable, and ergonomic on your ears. The controls are simple and functional and located in a position the is very convenient. The blue tooth is great for all music, videos, phone calls, etc. If using this product for gaming, I highly recommend using an auxiliary cable to suit your needs. The auxiliary cable makes the sounds better, louder, and gives you a bit more base when playing video games. I compared these headphones against Logitech G933 gaming headphones, against JBL 130 NC ear buds, against Sony C300 wireless head buds, and against Sony extra base headphones. I must honestly say that these headphones beat all the other competitors easily in comfort, sound, battery life, and ease of use. The closest competitor was the Logitech G933. Final comments are good headphones, light weight, comfortable, great sound, and very economical price. Highly recommended.

5.0 out of 5 stars Battery life - what kind of witchcraft is this?!
Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2022
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
I read the description of these headphones and didn't believe the battery life they advertised, mainly because I wear my headphones in Bluetooth mode between 18-20 hrs a day. I figured that I probably use headphones more rigorously than the average user but even with a fraction of the advertised battery life, I'd still be happy.

I bought them in late 2021 (November-ish) and it's now late February and they have completely performed as advertised. I legitimately only have to charge these things 1x week (some times less frequently)! And they really do charge really quickly!

I'm not a sound expert but I take phone calls on them all the time and haven't had any kind of problem with them for that (I have had that with other BT headphones before), I use them for everything from watching YouTube, listening to music & listening to Podcasts to taking online work meetings across multiple apps. I rarely need to but I've had it connected to both my phone and laptop at the same time as well. I've only used the "EQ" setting a couple of times but it took the song I was listening to from just regular & audible to feeling like I was surrounded with the music. It works well with audio that is made to sound like it's coming from different angles, too. I've even been watching something on my phone and heard a sound that I never noticed before but forgot I was wearing headphones and thought the sound was coming from the room I was in.

I think they're really good for the price based on the battery life alone and am really glad that I tried them before spending wayyy more on a designer brand.

I purchased these headphones, and they have been great. I use them for just about everything and they are great. The battery last's long and charges fast. They are comfortable, and the design is simple but does not look too large or silly compared to other over-ear options. Most of all they are durable, I wear them working out, in the rain dropped them etc and they have been totally fine. I also enjoy knowing that if I make a mistake and break them, they are only 30 dollars so it is not as big of a deal if I used a more expensive option. As for the sound quality, it is solid and totally good for anyone using them for basic things. These have made me realize that I don't care as much about high quality sound as I thought and I am just as happy with something more basic, but they still sound very good. The Bluetooth is very easy to use aswell. Overall this is the best and most simple pair of Bluetooth headphones I have bought for under 100 dollars, and they are only 30. Totally recommend. (I also don't write reviews normally so I went out of my way to say they are good)

I have had wireless ear buds, and I always have the same issue - they either are very insecure, or are very easy to lose. In my case, I tend to lose them eventually, no matter how much I try to watch them like a hawk, they just seem to disappear eventually. So I wanted just plain over the ear, old school headphones, that are still wireless, because something connected and this size is very hard to lose.

I have used them every day at work for nearly a year, I get 2-3 hours a night of use from them, charging them about once every 2 weeks. I listen to alot of music, and podcasts, and in both areas they seem great to me, but I am 100% not an "Audiophile", just a normal guy listening to what I like, and to me I have no complaints.

I really wanted ones that had a metal band and metal hinges. I have had gaming headsets that had plastic bands, or hinges and when they break - nothing can fix broken plastic, and they just have to be thrown out, even if the headphones themselves still work, you can't wear them any more. So having metal bands and hinges mattered alot to me, and so far, a year later, they are doing great.

I got a pair for my friend recently, and she loves them. Overall, these seem to be a great product at a good price.

I bought these headphones for my daughter, who would listen to music 24/7 if she could.

After charging (her device said they were only 90% charged, despite being fully charged according to the instructions and light on the headphones), we connected them to her Samsung tablet. Very easy to connect through bluetooth. I say this after multiple headaches with my own Sony bluetooth headphones.

The aux cord is great, so she can listen to music through her Echo Dot. I knew going in that these would not connect wirelessly to her Echo Dot, but, with the cord, they're perfect. She just has to sit and listen, which is fine when she's drawing and painting.

I wanted to make sure the sound quality was good. I only partially trusted the reviews I read prior to purchase. The sound quality is AMAZING. I feel like she got a better pair of headphones than I did, and I own some $200-something Sony headphones.

The volume buttons on her headphones literally control the volume on the device, unlike some volume control buttons when you're connected through bluetooth. We watched the Samsung dial go up and down as we pressed the buttons. (We're easily amused.) The headphones also have a play/pause button and an EQ button.

We bought the blue/gold version and it's so pretty! These headphones have surpassed our expectations for $30. Maybe they'll last longer than her earbuds typically do.

I was surprised that for such affordable headphones they connected to all my devices simultaneously and allows me to just hear the one that is playing. And they super comfortable, they adjust enough for my big head.

5.0 out of 5 stars I almost cried… autistic user
Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2022
Color: Navy BlueVerified Purchase
I bought these because I’m autistic and extra sensitive to sound and have noisy kids I’m home with during the day. I also like to listen to audiobooks while I’m cleaning and cooking but earbuds don’t stay in. These are my first pair of over-ear headphones that I got to pick out for myself. I don’t know why, but when I pulled them out of the bag I almost cried. They are so beautiful!! They look really expensive to me.
I wish I could’ve recorded a video of me hearing Demi Lovato’s Nightingale through them for the first time, but I couldn’t record and listen at the same time through my phone. I was flapping my hands with joy. The sound is SO GOOD. It has a couple different EQ settings. The bass setting is awesome.
Besides the look, the comfort is beyond what I was expecting. Fits very nicely over my ears without catching them underneath the pads. They aren’t tight, but I was rocking and shaking my head and they stayed put.
I only gave a 4-star for noise canceling because with music off they only barely muffle sound.
They come with a high-quality waterproof bag, instruction pamphlet, USB charging cable and AUX cable.

5.0 out of 5 stars My Favorite Amazon Purchase Yet!
Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2022
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
This product is PHENOMENAL. I use them for meditations, and they are great at blocking out 90% of noise, which I love. The only times noise isn’t canceled is in the case of high traffic noise and when someone is yelling to get your attention. For a closer reference, they do block out the sound of my sewing machine, which is heavy duty and rather loud so I’m very happy with them!

It does have 3 sound settings, equilibrium, vocal, and bass mode, which are all phenomenal for different reasons. I primarily use vocal mode for podcast, and bass mode for music.

I do sleep on my side, and I do move quite a bit in my sleep. Despite this, the headphones are VERY sturdy and despite my mistreatment (LOL) and ADHD brain tossing them everywhere, they are holding up like they are brand new.

I’m more than pleased with these headphones, and and especially at this price point

I cannot get used to wearing earbuds. I've tried several and they always hurt my ears. I decided to try out headphones and love these! So much more comfortable! I will say if it's a hot day, it will make your ears sweaty, but I'm sure in cold weather they'll be great for keeping my ears warm. Great price for an great product.

5.0 out of 5 stars Great Batter Life
Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2022
Color: PurpleVerified Purchase
This review is from a lay person. I am not a musician nor can I discern whether the bass or pitch is or not. I can only go by whether it sounds good. For me these headphones sound great, are reasonably priced and have great batter life. Music sounds good. My audiobooks sound great. I use these when I walk my dog and the sound comes through great even when I am walking on the sidewalk with cars whizzing by. Love these headphones. I usually have to replace them, not because of the sound, but because the plastic wears out. I do use them everyday and am pretty rough with them. It is a great buy and I highly recommend.

Love these Headphones. Inexpensive and great sound quality. They are comfortable and adjustable. I broke my last pair when I dropped them, totally my fault. The sound quality is just as good with the audio Jack.
Deal breaker for me was I tried Noise Cancelling headphones and I just had to have this feature. These headphones hug around your ear and definitely muffle noise but they are not designed to cancel noise. The other deal breaker is with my last pair they came with a nice hard case these did not and came with a sack. (Yuck) no protection there. So I returned these and purchased a pair of noise cancelling headphones that fold and came with a hard clam case. Don’t get me wrong these are excellent headphones, they just need to offer a pair with noise cancelling and bring back the hard, clam cell case.

I bought these for the gym and they were very inexpensive. (I really couldn't justify paying 5-10X's more for other headphones for gym use.) I wasn't expecting much, but I was wrong. The sound is incredibly impressive for the price. The build is solid and they are very comfortable. The equalizer button is easy to use to change sound. I used for 1.5 hours at the gym at a pretty high volume. The battery was at 90% when I started. When I was done, it was till at 90%. Battery life appears to be as advertised. Highly recommend them considering the price.

I bought these headphones a few weeks ago and I LOVE THEM. Not only do the look rad, they're also comfy and sound great! I got them to replace a much more expensive set of Bose headphones that I'd had for years which fell apart because I used them so much, and these are up to the task. If you're looking for a less expensive set but still want good quality, I say these are it!
