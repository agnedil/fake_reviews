      "5.0 out of 5 stars A17 great bang for your buck. And waterprooof.\n",
      "Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2023\n",
      "Verified Purchase\n",
      "They are great ear buds they are loud and the music is always crisp and clear. They fit in my ear just great and the ear hooks are what I need because air pods fall out on me. As for the microphone function it is great and I can hear the people I’m talking to and they can hear me and doesn’t sound like a tin can and eliminates much of the background noise. It has a long battery life with double led displays showing all battery strengths. I would recommend getting another pair for my family. Since my purchase I get in the car in the morning and the phone pairs to the car's audio system. When I get to work, I park the car, reach into my bag and take out either the left or the right bud, and put it in my ear. It turns on and connects immediately, with audible notifications, and the music automatically switches from the car to the bud without any button pushes. Then I just turn off the car and go. It is easy to pause the music with a single tap to the outside of the bud. The buds have other touch controls, but I never use them because the Apple Watch serves as a remote for the phone's music app. I am able to make phone calls with either bud, so each one has a mic. The iPhone automatically defaults to use the buds for calls, so I can easily receive calls by answering and hanging up using my watch or the phone itself, although there are controls that will allow one to answer and hang up using taps on the buds.. I can also use talk to text on the watch or the phone. The music automatically resumes when the mic is no longer being used. I can also summon Siri using \"Hey Siri.\".The case is nice but a bit bulky but nice to have wireless charging.\n",
      "Battery: The battery will not make it through eight hours of continuous play, but the case charges the bud quickly and you can get a few more hours after only a 15-minute charge. I charge the case once a week, which takes 2 hours. The case also has an indicator that tells you the approximate battery life remaining on the case. It tells you the percentage of charge from what I have experienced. When the battery gets low, a voice comes on to remind you, and it is very persistent, even when you pause the music. So you really have to put the bud back in the case.\n",
      "Fit: I was amazed at how well these fit. I am 5'6\" and I have a small head, so I thought my ears would be too small. The buds come with size adjustment inserts, but I tried them and they didn't improve the fit. The inserts that came pre-installed worked fine. They stay in place with the ear hooks.I don't feel any discomfort after wearing them for a 10-hour shift.\n",
      "Sound: I don't know much about sound quality relative to the big name brands. I know what music should sound like, and I feel that these supply a rich, balanced sound and good volume level with very little grain or background noise. I know that if I wear both buds and turn the volume up, I will be in my own little world.\n",
      "Overall these buds are a great value for the price and I am looking forward to enjoying my music library at work for as long as I can.\n",

      "I recently purchased the Boloxa A17 wireless headphones, and I must say, they left me thoroughly impressed. These headphones are nothing short of phenomenal, offering a fantastic audio experience coupled with impressive features that are hard to believe at such an affordable price point.\n",
      "One of the standout features of the Boloxa A17 is its wide and balanced frequency response. Whether you're a fan of bass-heavy beats or prefer the crisp clarity of high notes, these headphones deliver an exceptional audio performance across the entire sound spectrum. The sound quality is rich, immersive, and highly satisfying, making it an absolute joy to listen to music, podcasts, or any other audio content.\n",
      "Battery life is another area where the Boloxa A17 truly shines. With an incredibly long-lasting battery that can easily survive more than a week's worth of visits to the gym without needing a recharge, these headphones are perfect for individuals with an active lifestyle. You no longer have to worry about running out of battery midway through your workout or daily routine. The convenience of such extended battery life is truly commendable.\n",
      "One common frustration with wireless headphones is the fear of them falling out and getting lost. However, the Boloxa A17 comes with an ingenious design that addresses this concern. These headphones are anchored securely to your ears, ensuring a snug fit and eliminating the risk of them slipping off during exercise or vigorous activities. This feature alone sets them apart from many other wireless headphones on the market.\n",
      "The inclusion of a charging case with a battery life indicator and charging status further enhances the overall user experience. This handy addition allows you to keep track of the remaining battery life of both the headphones and the case itself, ensuring that you never run out of power unexpectedly. It's a small but thoughtful detail that adds convenience and peace of mind.\n",
      "One aspect that left me astounded was the affordability of the Boloxa A17. Given the exceptional audio quality, long-lasting battery life, and secure fit, it's hard to fathom how they manage to manufacture such an outstanding product at such a reasonable price point. It's a testament to the brand's commitment to providing value to its customers without compromising on quality.\n",
      "In conclusion, the Boloxa A17 wireless headphones are a remarkable choice for anyone seeking a phenomenal audio experience, extended battery life, secure fit, and convenience. The wide and balanced frequency response ensures an enjoyable listening experience across all genres of music, while the long-lasting battery eliminates the hassle of frequent recharging.

      "I gave the Boloxr A17 Wireless Sport Headphones a shot, and I'm genuinely impressed. The sound quality is spot-on – not too heavy on the bass like my Beats headphones. The noise cancellation feature works like a charm, helping me stay focused on my music and videos without any disturbances.\n",
      "What amazed me was how long the battery held up – they powered through the entire day while I listened to my music all day and watched some videos in between. Comfort-wise, they've got it right. The different attachments ensure a snug fit that feels tailor-made.\n",
      "One thing I really appreciate is the ear hook design – it gives a secure fit, so I don't have to worry about them slipping off while I'm on the move.\n",
      "Considering the price, I'd say these headphones are a smart buy. I'm more than satisfied with my purchase and would definitely consider getting another pair in the future.\n",
      "If you're looking for reliable wireless sport headphones that sound great and feel comfy? Definitely get these! Honestly, out of all my headphones, from high-end to cheap, these are honestly in my top three, no cap 🧢 lol! Had to slip that in.\n",
      "Edit: had an issue with one of the ear pieces not charging and they refunded me and sent me a replacement pair. Will definitely just from them again.\n",

      "They are comfortable, even though they’re sporty; the around the ear the design is unlike any other I’ve tried. I have yet to run the battery all the way to 0% which they also have a digital meter inside the charging case which is cool too. I’ve left my phone in the car and gone into my local grocery store. And my audiobook kept playing until I went down an aisle. The range was at least 100-120 feet. Through a wall. Pretty amazing. So far the only negative is the charging case is big. But I can work with it. It’s harder to lose it at least. And it’s unlike other people’s. So it won’t get stolen. Haha 😆\n",
