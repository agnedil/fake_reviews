I spoke with Amazon support (who were excellent) and stepped through a number of other procedures (removing then resetting the earbuds etc.) to no avail.

One wireless earbuds are a must have and just because something is more expensive doesn't mean they are going to work any better then something half the price and it doesn't make them any fancier just because they were more money.

My biggest fear was the lack of convenience that these would bring compared to the apple solution. However, outside of the standard bluetooth pairing, the experience is the same. Apple allows you to just open the case and they connect- these require you to initially set them up through settings. However, once that is done, taking one or both out of the case will instantly sync them up. You can take just one out of the case and use it, which is what I do, and the other will continue charging.

I came across the Beben bluetooth earbuds here on Amazon and loved the great reviews. I then watched a few unboxing vids about them. It seems that no one really had anything bad to really say about them. So, we ordered two sets. They arrive on time and in great shape. Straight out of the box, they had enough charge to turn on, pair, and play music for me for four hours.

Also, if you don't turn them off and they're not in your ears you may wonder why your phone has no sound; human error? I don't know.

Sometimes I’d plug them into the PLUGGED IN fully charged case, and they still wouldn’t charge. I’d find out randomly that my earbuds were on (and using charge) in the case, therefore making my phone only play sound through Bluetooth. This is when I manually turned them off before plugging them in as well. Just super annoying, and definitely not something I should have to replace two months later.

       " \"Once everything was ready to go, making the Bluetooth connection was easy. My phone found the device instantly and the LED indicators on the earbuds flashed blue/white as it was pairing. There is also a voice notification that you can hear when turning on/off or when connecting. I kept the instructions handy as it has a complete list of commands that involves clicking the respective buttons on each earbud. That is a real plus for me as my other set involved tapping in different locations. Once I had Spotify up and running I really was not prepared for how great these sound, unbelievable! The bass is incredible and the sound is really rich. Clicking the buttons to skip songs and turn volume up/down worked well. They seal very well in the ear and completely block out any outside noise, I can't wait to use these to mow lawn! I used them for a couple of hours at a time but have not run them long enough at a time to drain the batteries yet so I can't comment on how long they actually last. Very impressed so far, now to order a set for the wife.\",\n",

I used a different usb cable that was 3 feet long to charge to full charge. The wireless earbuds were charged to full within 1 hr. You have to for sure read the directions to know to take off the tiny tiny plastic cover over the charging pins on the earpiece to be able to pair to your device. Easily paired with iphone 8plus. The sound is better than another pair I already own. The sound is clear. I walked away from my device up to 30 feet without any interference or drop of quality in sound from my device. I was listening to a movie while I work remote and walked away to put something up in a closet. I have had them on now for 6 hours and still going strong on battery life. the directions say 5 hours of listening time and 70 hours of standby time. I keep waiting to hear the power low notification. The earbuds are very comfortable I tried both and then I went with just one so I can hear for other sounds in the house. The earbuds fit solid in my tiny ear canal and seals out noises around me. The quality of the sound is pretty incredible for $30 wireless earbuds. They also have a couple of iOS only directions to access siri which my others do not have this feature. Buy these I know you will not be disappointed in the quality of these bluetooth wireless earbuds. They are also waterproof so you could listen to tunes or the news in the shower. You can't dive with them though besides I don't know why you would want to wear them while diving. Great distance of at least 25-30 feet without dropping the quality of sound or disconnecting.

Phone calls are CRYSTAL clear on both ends. They have an extremely low profile and do not look all big and bulky in the ear which was a huge plus as well ... Another cool thing is that they seem to fit and seal inside the ear perfectly cancelling all outside noise. It literally feels like you are in your own little world!!! Pairing literally is instant and no hassle ! The charger is also pretty nice ... Its a rubber coated round tiny charger / case wich is water resistant and TINY and doubles as a keychain =D !!! It can be charged with any MICRO USB charger which is also awesome, eliminating the need to carry an extra charger or special adapter etc. I have indeed purchased other sets for more money as well as a few others in the same price point and these are by far my favorite set now . I have literally never had a set that exceeded my expectations like these have . Perfect sealed fit, low profile, superb sound , great bass, noise canceling, crystal clear and a nice little charger as well ... NOw this leads to my last point and a really important one ...

The blue tooth is great for all music, videos, phone calls, etc. If using this product for gaming, I highly recommend using an auxiliary cable to suit your needs.

I found out they are far more superior in quality in person. They just don't photograph well. The case is hefty. It's very solid, well protected with a magnetized clamshell lid. It's not going shatter if you drop it. The exterior of the case has a rubberized coating. This was not mentioned in other peer reviews. To me, that impressed me. It means they designed it to provide extra grip versus the slick or cheaper matte finishes. This will also hide fingerprints, too. The buds are plastic, however they are of a higher quality material with no loose parts or gaps in the ear bud cases themselves. The packaging presentation is on par with a higher end product. This isn't something seen at a $31 price point (as of this writing). The closest you could get to these may be the JLab Go Air, but those don't have an enclosed case nor does it offer WIRELESS CHARGING.

       "  'I ordered these primarily to use for workouts and to listen to music while studying. I had been looking into getting some quality true wireless earbuds for a while, but quite honestly I did not want to make the investment in AirPods. I think AirPods are all hype, especially after trying these earbuds out.',\n",
       "  'Pros:',\n",
       "  '- The sound quality was amazing and I was extremely impressed by the bass quality on these things. I listen to a wide variety of music genres but I am definitely a fan of songs with some bass in it, and these allowed me to enjoy such songs. I did not experience this with the AirPods',\n",
       "  '- The charging case and the earbuds themselves are super sleek. The earbuds magnetically connect to the charging case and the charging case also closes magnetically',\n",
       "  \"- I was also surprised with how well a job these did with noise cancelling. I couldn't hear anybody talking to me while I had them in\",\n",
       "  '- Pairing was super simple initially and now they connect automatically once I take them out of the case and automatically turn off once I replace them back in the case',\n",
       "  '- Siri and other command functions are very convenient',\n",
       "  'Cons:',\n",
       "  \"- I was surprised with the fact there were command functions on these earbuds but I couldn't imagine someone who had hands any bit bigger than I did being able to use the tiny buttons with ease\",\n",
       "  '- Talking on the phone I could hear the other person OK but my voice sounded mumbled',\n",
       "  'All in all these are an amazing alternative to AirPods for someone who wants totally wireless earbuds that are good quality, without the expense of AirPods. The only thing missing that the Airpods have are the little image that pops up on your device when pairing and they automatically pause when you take them out of your ear. If you can live without that and are just looking for quality wireless earbuds then these are for you!',\n",

      "I loved these earbuds for months, and still do! Excellent sound quality, easy connection, just wonderful! I loved them so much I bought my boyfriend a pair immediately, and boy have they been helpful as we both worked from home during the pandemic! The charging case is brilliant, and I love how they turn on/off automatically when you take them out or put them in the case. I bought them for running, and they were excellent! I wear them frequently with a mask and they don’t feel uncomfortable at all, nor do they fall out when taking on/off the mask.\n",
      "My reason for 3 stars though..... the battery life was previously amazing, I felt like I could use these for so long and they wouldn’t die! The charging case was awesome too as I stated above. However, after using them for about 2 months, the charging case stopped charging them. Sometimes I’d plug them into the PLUGGED IN fully charged case, and they still wouldn’t charge. I’d find out randomly that my earbuds were on (and using charge) in the case, therefore making my phone only play sound through Bluetooth. This is when I manually turned them off before plugging them in as well. Just super annoying, and definitely not something I should have to replace two months later. I contacted the company and after several messages that were difficult to understand, they agreed to send me replacements. If I receive a replacement and the charging issue was a one time thing, I will definitely edit my review!\n",
      "*****Edit 8/8/20.... I received my replacements in two days! They are EXCELLENT and I was pleased to see they now take a USB-C charger! This means basically nothing to me but my techie boyfriend says it’s a major upgrade 😂 I see no issues with the charging case at all in this new pair so I think my other pair was just a fluke! I’ve used these nearly all day and they’re still going! 👏🏻 Definitely buy these earbuds, one of the best buys of 2020 for me, even with the charging case issue!\n",

So as my purpose is for listening music at night.. and i still cant get over the surround sound like of the quality.. it made me say whoa.. coz specially on instrumentals... i could actually hear each and every instruments on its own.. crystal clear.. ever the fades and crescendos... whaa.. so many things going on... what an experience... and its just the first 2 hrs. I Hope its durable coz i do use ear pieces alot.. wait for an update in a week. THANKS! So Far... 100% satisfaction! Highly recommended.\n",
